# What Is Back Pain?

## Who experiences back pain?

Lower back pain, sometimes called lumbago, is not a specific disease diagnosis. It’s a symptom of several different types of medical problems.

It usually results from a problem with one or more parts of the lower back, such as:

* ligaments and muscles

* discs

* intervertebral discs

* nerves

* the bony structures that make up the spine, called vertebral bodies or vertebrae

It can also be due to a problem with nearby organs, such as thekidneys.

According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons,75 to 85 percentof Americans will experience back pain in their lifetime. Of those, 50 percent will have more than one episode within a year.

In 90 percent of all cases, the pain gets better without surgery. Talk with a doctor if you’re experiencing back pain.

## Back pain treatment

Many people will not need extensive treatment for back pain. Over-the-counterpain medicationsare often sufficient.

In more severe cases, stronger treatments may be necessary, but they’re typically provided under close supervision from your doctor.

### Medication

The majority of back pain episodesare relievedby treatment withnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as:

* ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)

* naproxen (Aleve)

Analgesics, such asacetaminophen (Tylenol), are another category of pain relievers. They are also an option for back pain, though they don’t have the anti-inflammatory properties.

Be careful with medications likeibuprofenif you have kidney problems orstomach ulcers.

Never take more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter medications without a doctor’s recommendation, as even these medications may have severe side effects if taken incorrectly.

Other medication optionsinclude:

Topical products may be highly effective at reducing back pain. Many of these contain ingredients like ibuprofen and lidocaine and come in the form of:

* gels

* lotions

* creams

* patches

* sprays

Muscle relaxantscan also be used for lower back pain, especially ifmuscle spasmsoccur alongside pain. These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce pain.

Antidepressantsand other medications can sometimes be usedoff-labelfor the treatment of back pain.

If your back pain is severe, your doctor may prescribeamitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, because it focuses on different parts of the pain response. This antidepressant may also work better for nerve-related pain.

Your doctor might alsorecommendcortisone steroid injections for certain causes of back pain. For example, a person with back pain that involves a nerve may get a cortisone steroid injection.

Opioids are stronger pain medications that can be prescribed for more severe pain. These medications, such asoxycodone (OxyContin)and a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone (Vicodin), act on the brain cells and body to reduce pain.

Opioids should be used with caution, however, due to a risk ofaddiction.

### Surgery

Surgery is usually reserved for those with structural abnormalities that haven’t responded to nonsurgical treatment with medication and therapy.

Surgery may be an option for people with:

* severe, constant pain with identifiable structural abnormalities

* nerve compressionthat causes muscles to become weak

* spinal cord compression that limits daily activities

### Alternative medicine

Alternative therapies thatmay helprelieve back pain include:

* acupuncture

* massage

* chiropractic adjustments

* cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

* relaxation techniques

Be sure to talk with your doctor before undergoing any alternative or complementary treatment. If you’re experiencing back pain,these lower back pain treatment options might be helpful.

## Back pain home remedies

Many home remedies can be used with traditional back pain treatments. If you have questions about these, talk with your doctor.

### Heat and ice therapy

Ice packsmay relieve discomfort andhelplessen inflammation in short-term phases of back pain.Note:Don’t apply the ice directly to your skin. Wrap it in a thin towel or gauze to prevent damage to your skin.

Warm compressesmay also relieve pain when inflammation has gone down. Consider switching between heat and cold.

### Exercises

Exercises to improve posture and strengthen the back and abdominal muscles — called the core muscles — are a treatment option that should be strongly considered.

This treatment often involves:

* improving posture

* using proper lifting techniques

* strengthening core muscles

* stretching muscles to improve flexibility

Aphysical therapistcan teach you how to perform these types of exercises at home.

### Essential oils

Researchsuggests thatessential oilorointmentsmade with capsaicin may help decrease pain.

Capsaicin is the ingredient in peppers that makes them hot. These ingredients may desensitize the nerves in the affected area and decrease the pain you feel.

Home remedies may be highly effective at reducing back pain.Learn more about how to use them and how they work.

## Back pain causes

Themost commoncauses of lower back pain are strain and problems with back structures.

### Strain

Strained musclesoften cause back pain. Strain commonly occurs with incorrect lifting of heavy objects and sudden awkward movements.

Strain can also result from overactivity. An example is the sore feeling and stiffness that occurs after a few hours of yard work or playing a sport.

### Structural problems

Vertebrae are the interlocking bones stacked on top of one another that make up the spine. Discs are areas of tissue that cushion the spaces between each vertebra. Disc injuries are afairly commoncause of back pain.

Sometimes these discs can bulge, herniate, or rupture. Nerves can get compressed when this happens.

Herniated discscan be very painful. Abulging discpressing on the nerve that travels from your back and down your leg can cause sciatica or irritation of the sciatic nerve.Sciaticacan be experienced in your leg as:

* pain

* tingling

* numbness

### Arthritis

Spinal osteoarthritisis also a potential cause of back pain. It’s caused by damage and deterioration in the cartilage of joints in your lower back.

Over time, this condition can lead to narrowing of the spinal column, orspinal stenosis.

### Osteoporosis

Loss of bone density and thinning of the bone, calledosteoporosis, can lead to small fractures in your vertebrae. These fractures can cause serious pain and are referred to ascompression fractures.

### Other causes of back pain

There are many other potential causes of back pain, but most are rare. Be sure to see a doctor if you experience regular back pain that does not go away.

After ruling out the more common causes of back pain, your doctor will perform tests to determine if you have a rarer cause. These caninclude:

* one of the vertebrae moving out of place and onto a nearby vertebra, called degenerativespondylolisthesis

* loss of nerve function at the lower spinal cord, calledcauda equina syndrome(a medical emergency)

* fungal or bacterial infection of the spine, such asStaphylococcus,E. coli, ortuberculosis

* cancer ornoncancerous (benign) tumorin the spine

* kidney infectionorkidney stones

## Back pain symptoms

Back pain can have many symptoms, including:

* a dull, aching sensation in the lower back

* a stabbing or shooting pain that can radiate down the leg to the foot

* an inability to stand up straight without pain

* a decreased range of motion and reduced ability to flex the back

The symptoms of back pain, if due to strain or misuse, are usually short lived but can last for days or weeks.

Back pain is chronic when symptoms have been present forlonger than3 months.

### Back pain symptoms that may indicate a serious problem

See your doctor if back pain doesn’t improve within 2 weeks of developing. There are times when back pain can be a symptom of a serious medical problem.

Symptoms that can indicate a more serious medical problem are:

* loss ofbowelorbladder control

* numbness, tingling, or weakness in one or both legs

* back pain after trauma (injury), such as a fall or a blow to the back

* intense, constant pain that gets worse at night

* unexplained weight loss

* pain associated with a throbbing sensation in the abdomen

* fever

Let your doctor know if you have any of these symptoms.

## Back pain diagnosis

A physical exam istypicallyall that’s needed to diagnose back pain. During the physical exam, your doctor may test your:

* ability to stand and walk

* spine’s range of motion

* reflexes

* leg strength

* ability to detect sensations in your legs

If a serious condition is suspected, your doctor might order other tests,including:

* blood andurine teststo check for underlying conditions

* X-raysof the spine to show alignment of your bones and check for breaks

* CT scanorMRI scanto assess your discs, muscles, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels

* bone scanto look for abnormalities in the bone tissue

* electromyography (EMG)to test nerve signals

## How to prevent back pain

These tips can help ease back pain when it happens. They can also help you prevent back pain in the first place.

Heavy briefcases, laptop bags, suitcases, and purses can add unnecessary stress and strain to your neck and spine.

Try to reduce what you need to carry, and use bags that distribute the weight more evenly, such as a backpack. If you can, use a bag with wheels to keep weight off your back entirely.

The muscles in and around your abdomen and back help keep you upright and carry you through your physical activities. Strengthening them can also reduce the chances of pain, strain, or damage to your back.

Plugstrength training workoutswith acore focusinto your regular fitness routine a few times a week.

Poorposturecan put unnecessary pressure and strain on your spine. Over time, thiscan leadto pain and damage.

Regularly remind yourself to roll back rounded shoulders and sit upright in your chair.

High-heeled shoes are likely tocausedamage to your back if you wear them frequently. Pick comfortable, supportive, and minimally elevated heeled shoes when you can.

Doing the same thing every daycan leaveyour muscles fatigued and more likely to strain.Stretchregularly to help improve circulation in those muscles and lower the risk of back pain and damage.

## Risk factors for back pain

You may have an increased risk for back painif you:

* work in a sedentary (inactive) environment

* don’t exercise

* engage in high impact activity without stretching or warming up first

* are older

* have obesity

* are a smoker

* have been diagnosed with a specific condition likearthritis

Your mental health also has an effect on your risk of back pain. You may be at a higher risk of back pain if you have a stressful job or havedepressionandanxiety.

## Back pain and pregnancy

Back pain duringeach trimesterof your pregnancy can be common, and several causes are to blame. However, you should be sure to talk with your doctor about what you’re experiencing, in case the pain may be part of a bigger problem.

Here are afew reasonswhy you may be experiencing back pain during pregnancy:

As your baby grows, the center of your body’s “gravity” moves outward. Your spine and back arch to make up for the change in balance. This put extra stress on the lower lumbar spine.

Weight gaincan be a healthy part of pregnancy, but even the little bit you’re likely to gain during those 9 months can put more stress on your back and core muscles.

As your body prepares to deliver the baby, it releaseshormonesthat loosen the ligaments that stabilize your pelvis and lumbar spine. These same hormones can cause the bones in your spine to shift, which may lead to discomfort and pain.

## Exercises to help your back pain

Gentle stretches and easy exercises can help ease back pain and prevent future problems.

Here are two exercises you can try. These moves require no special equipment and can be performed anywhere you can access an area of open floor. A yoga mat is recommended but not necessary.

### Bridges

* Lie on the ground with your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.

* With your hands by your sides, press your feet into the floor as you slowly lift your buttocks off the ground until your body is in one straight line. Keep your shoulders on the floor.

* Lower down. Rest for 1 minute.

* Repeat 15 times.

* Perform 3 sets.

* Lie on your stomach. Stretch your arms above your head and lengthen your legs straight behind you.

* Slowly lift your hands and feet off the ground. Start about 6 inches off the ground and go higher as you feel comfortable.

* Push through your belly button to lift your legs and arms off the ground. Stop when you feel your lower back contract. To prevent neck strain, keep your head down, looking at the ground.

* Hold your stretched posture for 2 to 3 seconds.

* Return to neutral and relax your muscles.

* Repeat this stretch 10 to 12 times.

# What Causes Mouth Ulcers and How to Treat Them

Mouth ulcers, which include canker sores, are small sores that develop within the mouth. There are no definite causes of mouth ulcers, but some injuries, allergies, or sensitivities may trigger them.

## Mouth Ulcers: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments



Mouth ulcers are painful and typically small lesions that develop in your mouth or at the base of your gums. They can make eating, drinking, and talking uncomfortable.

Types of mouth ulcers include canker sores and the sores caused by hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Mouth ulcers are rarely contagious and usually go awayafter 1 to 2 weeks, even without treatment. If you get a mouth ulcer that is large, is extremely painful, or lasts for a long time without healing, seek the advice of a doctor or dentist.

## Causes of mouth ulcers

There’s no definite cause behind mouth ulcers, but certain risk factors and triggers have been identified.

People assigned female at birth, children, adolescents, and those with a family history of mouth ulcers have a higher risk of developing them.

Triggers include:

* minor mouth injury from dental work, hard brushing, sports injury, or anaccidental bite

* dental braces

* toothpaste or mouthwash that containssodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)

* an allergic response tooral bacteria

* bacterial, viral, or fungal infections in the mouth, such ashand, foot, and mouth disease

* sensitivitiestoacidic foods and beverageslike strawberries, citrus fruits, pineapple, chocolate, and coffee

* certain nutrient deficiencies, especiallyvitamin B9 (folate),vitamin B12,zinc, andiron

* hormonal changes, such as those that occur duringmenstruationor pregnancy

* emotional stress

* lack of sleep

Mouth ulcers can also be a sign of conditions that are more serious and require medical treatment, such as:

* celiac disease

* inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), includingulcerative colitis

* diabetes

* HIV

* some autoimmune diseases, including:lupusoral lichen planusBehçet’s disease, a rare condition that causes inflammation throughout the blood vessels

* lupus

* oral lichen planus

* Behçet’s disease, a rare condition that causes inflammation throughout the blood vessels

## Mouth ulcer symptoms

Symptoms of mouth ulcers may vary depending on their cause, but they typically include:

* painful sores that may be yellow, white, or red

* sores on the inside of the mouth, such as on your tongue or the insides of your cheeks or lips

* areas of redness surrounding the sores

* pain that worsens when you eat, drink, or talk

You may have more than one mouth ulcer at the same time.

Mouth ulcers are not usually contagious unless they’re caused by an infection such as hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Canker soresare the most common type of mouth ulcer, with20% of peoplehaving a canker sore at least once. There are three main types of canker sores:

* minor

* major

* herpetiform

### Minor canker sore

Minor canker sores are small oval or round ulcers measuring under5 millimeters (mm). They heal within 1 to 2 weeks and don’t cause scars.

According to DermNet New Zealand,80% of peoplewith canker sores have minor canker sores, making them the most common type.

### Major canker sore

Major canker sores are larger and deeper than minor ones. They often measureover 10 mm.

They have irregular edges and can take weeks or months to heal. Major canker sores can result in long-term scarring.

### Herpetiform canker sore

Herpetiform canker sores are pinpoint-sized, occur in clusters, and often appear on the tongue. Sometimes the clusters can merge to form one large sore.

Herpetiform canker sores have irregular edges and often heal, without scarring,within 1 month.

They’re called “herpetiform” because they may resemble the sores caused byherpes. Herpetiform canker sores are not otherwise associated with herpes infection.

### When to see a doctor or dentist

See a doctor or dentist about your mouth ulcers if you develop any of the following:

* unusually large mouth ulcers

* new mouth ulcers that appear before the old ones heal

* sores that persist formore than 3 weeks

* painless sores

* sores that extend to the lips

* pain that you’re unable to manage with over-the-counter or natural medications

* severe problems eating and drinking

* high feverordiarrheawhenever your mouth ulcers appear

## Diagnosis of mouth ulcers

Your doctor will be able to diagnose mouth ulcers through a visual exam. You might be tested for other medical conditions if you have frequent, severe mouth ulcers.

## Mouth ulcer vs. cold sore

Acold soreis another common type of oral lesion. Although mouth ulcers and cold sores share some causes and symptoms, it’s usually easy to tell the two apart.

Mouth ulcers only appear inside the mouth.

Although cold sores can appear inside the mouth, they mainly appear right above, below, or on your lips. They may also spread to the nose orchin. Cold sores are also fluid-filled, making them a type ofblister.

Most mouth ulcers are not contagious. Cold sores are typically caused by the herpes virus and are always contagious.

Cold sores are also more likely to cause additional symptoms beyond the lesions, including:

* fever

* fatigue

* malaise

* swollen lymph nodesin the neck

Both types of lesions can cause a burning or tingling sensation on the skin that may start a few days before the lesions appear. However, this sensation is more closely associated with cold sores.

## Aphthous ulcers

Aphthous ulcer is another name for a canker sore. The medical term “aphtha” has a few definitions but is mostly used to refer to a small ulcer.

## Mouth ulcer treatment

Most mouth ulcers don’t need treatment.

However, if you get mouth ulcers often or they’re extremely painful, a number of treatments and home remedies can decrease pain and healing time. These include:

* covering the ulcer with a paste made frombaking soda

* using other topical pastes

* placing milk of magnesia on the ulcer

* using a mouth rinse made fromsalt waterand baking soda

* using a mouth rinse that contains a steroid to reduce pain and swelling

* applying ice to the ulcer

* placing a damp tea bag on the ulcer

* taking supplements if you have deficiencies in certain nutrients, including vitamin B9 (folate), vitamin B12, zinc, and iron

* using over-the-counter topical products that are made with benzocaine, like Orajel and Anbesol

* trying natural remedies, such asechinacea,myrrh, andlicorice root(may come in various forms, like teas or oils)

## How to prevent mouth ulcers

You can take these steps to help reduce the occurrence of mouth ulcers:

* Avoid foods that irritate your mouth. That includes acidic fruits, nuts, chips, and anything spicy. Instead, choosewhole grainsand nonacidic fruits and vegetables. Eat awell-balanced dietand consider taking a daily multivitamin.

* Try to avoid talking while you’re chewing your food to reduce accidental bites.

* Reduce your stress.

* Maintain good oral hygiene byflossingdaily andbrushingafter meals.

* Avoid hard-bristled toothbrushes and mouthwashes containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or alcohol.

* Ask your dentist to give you wax to cover dental or orthodontic mouth devices that have sharp edges.

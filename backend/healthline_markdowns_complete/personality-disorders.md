# Personality Disorder

## What is a personality disorder?

Personality disorders are a group of mental health conditions that are characterized by inflexible and atypical patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. These inner experiences and behaviors often differ from the expectations of the culture in which someone lives.

If you have a personality disorder, you may have a difficult time relating to others and dealing with everyday problems in the ways that are expected by your cultural group. You may not be fully aware of this discrepancy between your thoughts and behaviors and those accepted by society.

You may have a view of the world that’s quite different than that of others. As a result, you could find it difficult to participate in social, educational, and family activities.

These behaviors and attitudes often cause problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, and work or school settings. They may also make people you feel isolated, which can contribute todepressionandanxiety.

Personality disorders are treatable, however. Often a combination of talk therapy and medication can go a long way in helping you live with one of these conditions.

## What causes personality disorders?

The cause of personality disorders isn’t known. However, it’s believed that they may be triggered by genetic and environmental influences, most prominently childhood trauma.

Personality disorders tend to emerge in the teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms vary depending on the specific type of personality disorder. For all of them, treatment typically includes talk therapy and medication.

## How is a personality disorder diagnosed?

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), is a reference that doctors and mental health professionals use to help diagnose mental health conditions. Each personality disorder has criteria that must be met for a diagnosis.

A primary care doctor or mental health professional will ask you questions based on these criteria to determine the type of personality disorder. In order for a diagnosis to be made, the behaviors and feelings must be consistent across many life circumstances.

They should also cause significant distress and impairment in at least two of the following areas:

* the way you perceive or interpret yourself and other people

* the way you act when dealing with other people

* the appropriateness of your emotional responses

* how well you can control your impulses

In some cases, your primary care doctor or mental health professional may perform blood tests to determine whether a medical problem is causing your symptoms. In some cases, they may order a screening test for alcohol or drugs if they think substances are causing your symptoms.

## How is a personality disorder treated?

Treatment can vary depending on the type and severity of your personality disorder. It may include psychotherapy and medications.

### Psychotherapy

Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, may help in managing personality disorders. During psychotherapy, you and a therapist can discuss your condition, as well as your feelings and thoughts. This can provide you with insight on how to manage your symptoms and behaviors that interfere with your daily life.

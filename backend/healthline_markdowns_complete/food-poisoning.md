# What You Need to Know About Food Poisoning, Its Causes, and Treatments

Food poisoning usually isn’t life threatening. It can be uncomfortable, but most people recover completely within a few days, even without treatment.

## What is food poisoning?

Foodborne illness, typically known as food poisoning, results from eating contaminated, spoiled, or toxic food. The most common symptoms of food poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Although it’s quite uncomfortable, food poisoning isn’t unusual. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48 million people (around 1 in 7 people) in the United States contract some form of food poisoning every year. Of those 48 million people, 128,000 are admitted to hospitals.

## Food poisoning symptoms

If you have food poisoning, chances are it won’t go undetected. Thesymptomscan vary depending on the source of the infection.

A case of food poisoning will typically involve a few of the following symptoms:

* abdominal cramps

* diarrhea

* nausea

* vomiting

* loss of appetite

* mild fever

* weakness

* headache

Symptoms of potentially life threatening food poisoning include:

* diarrhea that lasts for more than 3 days

* a fever higher than102°F (38.9°C)

* difficulty seeing or speaking

* symptoms ofsevere dehydration, such as:dry mouthlittle to no urine outputdifficulty keeping fluids down

* dry mouth

* little to no urine output

* difficulty keeping fluids down

* bloody urine

If you experience any of these symptoms, contact a doctor or seek medical treatment immediately.

### How long does food poisoning last?

The length of time it takes for symptoms to appear depends on the source of the infection, but it can range from30 minutesto8 weeks.

With or without treatment, most cases will resolve within1 week.

## Causes of food poisoning

Most food poisoning can be traced to one of three major causes:

* bacteria

* parasites

* viruses

Thesepathogenscan be found on almost all food humans eat. However, heat from cooking usually kills the pathogens before the food reaches your plate. Foods eaten raw are common sources of food poisoning because they don’t go through the cooking process.

Occasionally, food comes into contact with organisms from fecal matter or vomit. This is most likely to happen when someone who is ill prepares food withoutwashing their handsfirst.

Some frequently contaminated foods are:

* meat

* eggs

* dairy

* water

### Bacteria

Bacteria are by far the most common cause of food poisoning. Bacterial causes of food poisoning include:

* E. coli— in particular, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)

* Listeria monocytogenes

* Salmonella

* Campylobacter

* Clostridium botulinum

* Staphylococcus aureus

* Shigella

* Vibrio vulnificus

When you think of dangerous bacteria, names such as “E. coli” and “Salmonella” likely come to mind — and for a good reason.

Salmonella isthe biggest bacterial causeof food poisoning cases in the United States. According to theCDC, an estimated 1.35 million cases of food poisoning, including 26,500 hospitalizations, can be traced to Salmonella infection each year.

### Parasites

Food poisoning caused byparasitesisn’t as common as food poisoning caused by bacteria, but parasites that spread through food are still very dangerous. They include:

* Toxoplasma gondii

* Giardia lamblia

* various tapeworms, such as:Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm)Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm)

* Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm)

* Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)

* Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm)

* Cryptosporidium

* Ascaris lumbricoides, a type of roundworm

* flukes (flatworms), such as Opisthorchiidae (liver fluke) and Paragonimus (lung fluke)

* pinworms, or Enterobiasis

* Trichinella

According to theCDC, toxoplasmosis is a leading cause of death attributed to food poisoning in the United States. Toxoplasma gondii is also found in cat litter boxes.

Parasites can live in your digestive tract and may go undetected for years.Pregnant peopleand those withweakened immune systemsare at risk of more serious side effects if certain parasites take up residence in their intestines.

### Viruses

Food poisoning can also be caused by a virus, such as:

* norovirus, which is sometimes known as the Norwalk virus

* rotavirus

* astrovirus

* sapovirus

* hepatitis A virus

The norovirus causes19 million to 21 million casesof vomiting and diarrhea in the United States each year. In rare cases, it can be fatal. Other viruses cause similar symptoms but are less common.

## Common sources

## Food poisoning treatments

Food poisoning can usually be treated at home. Here are some ways you can help treat food poisoning:

### Stay hydrated

If you have food poisoning, it’s crucial to stay properly hydrated. Sports drinks that arehigh in electrolytescan be helpful. Fruit juice and coconut water can restore carbohydrates and help withfatigue.

Try to avoidcaffeine, which may irritate your digestive tract. Decaffeinated teas made with soothing herbs may help calm an upset stomach. Examples include:

* chamomile

* peppermint

* dandelion

### Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications

OTC medications such as loperamide (Imodium) andPepto-Bismolcan help you manage diarrhea and suppress nausea.

Pyrantel pamoate (Reese’s Pinworm Medicine) is a commonremedyfor pinworms.

However, you should check with a doctor before using these medications because your body uses vomiting and diarrhea to get rid of the toxin. Also, using these medications could mask the severity of your condition and cause you to delay seeking expert treatment.

### Take prescription medications

Although many cases of food poisoning clear up on their own, you may benefit from prescription medications, depending on the pathogen responsible for your condition.

Prescription medications may be helpful if you are older, immunocompromised, or pregnant.Antibiotictreatmentcan help prevent an infection from transmitting to your unborn baby.

If you need prescription medications, a doctor may recommend the following medications for certain causes of foodborne illness:

* A. lumbricoides:the antiparasitic medications albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm)

* Campylobacter:the antibioticazithromycin(Zithromax)

* Cryptosporidium:the antiparasitic medication nitazoxanide (Alinia), which is used to treat diarrhea

* D. latum (fish tapeworm):the antiparasitic medication praziquantel (Biltricide)

* Enterobiasis (pinworms):albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm)

* G. lamblia:nitazoxanide (Alinia)the antibioticsmetronidazole(Flagyl), paromomycin, quinacrine, or furazolidonethe antibiotic and antiparasitic medication tinidazole (Tindamax)

* nitazoxanide (Alinia)

* the antibioticsmetronidazole(Flagyl), paromomycin, quinacrine, or furazolidone

* the antibiotic and antiparasitic medication tinidazole (Tindamax)

* L. monocytogenes:the antibioticampicillin

* Opisthorchiidae (liver fluke):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza)

* Paragonimus (lung fluke):praziquantel (Biltricide) or the antiparasitic medication triclabendazole (Egaten)

* Shigella:the antibiotics azithromycin (Zithromax) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro)

* T. saginata(beef tapeworm):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza), which areoff-label treatments

* T. solium(pork tapeworm):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza), which are off-label treatments

* T. gondii:a combination of the antiparasitic medication pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and an antibiotic such as sulfadiazinethe antibiotic spiramycin, as a stand-alone medication

* a combination of the antiparasitic medication pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and an antibiotic such as sulfadiazine

* the antibiotic spiramycin, as a stand-alone medication

* Trichinella:albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm)

Off-label drug use means a drug that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t yet been approved.

However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So a doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care.

### Receive an antitoxin

An infection with C. botulinum is considered a medical emergency. Seek medical care as soon as you can.

If you have a case of C. botulinum, a doctor will administer an antitoxin. Babies will receive a special antitoxin called BabyBIG (botulism immune globulin).

### Rest

It’s important to get plenty of rest when you’re recovering from food poisoning.

### Seek treatment for severe cases

In severe cases of food poisoning, you may need hydration withintravenous (IV) fluidsat a hospital.

In the very worst cases of food poisoning, a longer hospital stay may be required while you recover. Severe cases of C. botulinum, which are rare, may even requiremechanical ventilation.

## What you should try to eat

It’s best to avoid solid foods until diarrhea and vomiting have passed. Instead, ease back into your regular diet by eating or drinkingeasy-to-digest foodsthat areblandand low in fat, such as:

* saltine crackers

* toast

* gelatin

* bananas

* rice

* oatmeal

* bland potatoes

* boiled vegetables

* chicken broth

* soda without caffeine, such as ginger ale or root beer

* diluted fruit juices

* sports drinks

## What food you should try to avoid

To prevent your stomach from getting more upset, try to avoid the following harder-to-digest foods, even if you think you feel better:

* dairy products, especially milk and cheese

* fatty foods

* fried foods

* highly seasoned foods

* foods that are high in sugar

* spicy foods

Also avoid:

* caffeine

* alcohol

* nicotine

## How food poisoning is diagnosed

A doctor may be able to determine which type of food poisoning you have based on your symptoms.

In severe cases, healthcare professionals may performblood tests,stool tests, and tests on food that you’ve eaten to find out what’s responsible for your food poisoning. A doctor may also use aurine testto evaluate whether you are dehydrated due to food poisoning.

## Risk factors for food poisoning

Anyone can contract food poisoning. Statistically speaking, nearly everyone will experience food poisoning at least once in their lives.

Some populations are more at risk than others, including:

* Immunocompromised people:Anyone with a suppressed immune system or anautoimmune diseasemay have a greater risk of infection and complications resulting from food poisoning.

* Pregnant people:Pregnant people are more at risk because their bodies are coping with changes to their metabolism and circulatory system during pregnancy.

* Older adults:Adults 65 years old or older are at a greater risk of contracting food poisoning because their immune systems may not respond quickly to infectious organisms.

* Young children:Children under 5 years old are also considered an at-risk population because their immune systems aren’t as developed as those of adults. Young children are more easily affected bydehydrationfrom vomiting and diarrhea.

## How to prevent food poisoning

The best way to prevent food poisoning is to handle your food safely and avoid any food that may be unsafe.

Some foods aremore likelyto cause food poisoning because of how they’re produced and prepared. Infectious agents that are killed during cooking may be present in certain foods, such as:

* meat

* poultry

* eggs

* shellfish

Food poisoning can occur if these foods are eaten in their raw form if they are not cooked properly, or if people don’t properly clean their hands and other surfaces that have had contact with the food.

Other foods that are likely to cause food poisoning include:

* sushiandother fish productsthat are served raw or undercooked

* deli meats and hot dogs that aren’t heated or cooked

* ground beef, which may contain meat from several animals

* unpasteurized milk, cheese, and juice

* raw, unwashed fruits and vegetables

To try to avoid food poisoning, take these steps:

* Alwayswash your handsbefore cooking or eating food.

* Make sure your food is properly sealed andstored.

* Thoroughly cookmeatand eggs.

* Sanitize any surface or utensil that comes into contact with raw foods before using it to prepare other foods.

* Make sure towash fruits and vegetablesbefore serving them.

## Outlook for food poisoning

It’s extremely rare for food poisoning to be life threatening. While having food poisoning is quite uncomfortable, the good news is that most people recover completely within a few days, even without treatment.

## Frequently asked questions

### What’s the difference between food poisoning and a stomach bug?

Food poisoning typically starts to cause symptoms, such as diarrhea or vomiting, within 3 to 6 hours after you’ve eaten something. The stomach flu takes longer to cause symptoms — typically 12 to 24 hours.

## The takeaway

Millions of people get food poisoning every year. Many cases of bacterial, viral, or parasitic food poisoning are treatable, and food poisoning very rarely requires serious medical attention.

You can take certain steps to prevent food poisoning, such as washing your hands before preparing meals and avoiding raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and shellfish.

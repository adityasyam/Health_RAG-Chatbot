# CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)

The extreme and persistent fatigue from CFS lasts for at least 6 months and doesn’t go away with bed rest. Medications along with diet and lifestyle changes may help you manage symptoms.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder characterized by extremefatigueor tiredness that doesn’t go away with rest and can’t be explained by an underlying medical condition.

CFS can also be referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID).

The causes of CFS aren’t fully understood yet. Some theories includeviral infection, psychologicalstress, or a combination of factors.

Because no single cause has been identified, and because many other conditions produce similar symptoms, CFS can be difficult to diagnose.

There are no tests for CFS. Your doctor will have to rule out other causes for your fatigue when determining a diagnosis.

While CFS was previously a controversial diagnosis, it’s nowwidely acceptedas a medical condition.

CFS can affect anyone, though it’s most common amongwomenin their40s and 50s. There’s currently no cure, but treatment can relieve symptoms.

Here’s what you need to know about CFS, including symptoms, treatment options, and outlook.

## What causes CFS?

The cause of CFS is unknown. Researchers speculate that contributing factors may include:

* viruses

* aweakened immune system

* stress

* hormonal imbalances

It’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS.

Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by:

* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

* human herpesvirus 6

* Ross River virus (RRV)

* rubella virus

Infections caused by bacteria, includingCoxiella burnetiiandMycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS.

TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition.

In fact, about1 in 10 peoplewith EBV, Ross River virus, orCoxiella burnetiiinfection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.

Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.

People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.

People with CFS can also sometimes haveabnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.

Some people with CFS may concomitantly have some deficiencies in vitamins including B2 (riboflavin) or B12, but it is unclear if they improve with vitamin supplementation.

## Risk factors for CFS

CFS is most commonly seen among people in their 40s and 50s.

Sex also plays an important role in CFS, as women aretwo to four timesmore likely to be diagnosed with CFS than men.

Other factors that may increase your risk for CFS include:

* genetic predisposition

* allergies

* stress

* environmental factors

## What are the symptoms of CFS?

Symptoms of CFS vary based on the individual and the severity of the condition.

The most common symptom is fatigue that’s severe enough to interfere with your daily activities.

For CFS to be diagnosed, a significantly reduced ability to perform your usual daily activities with fatigue must last for at least 6 months. It must not be curable with bed rest.

You will also experienceextreme fatigue after physical or mental activities, which is referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM). This can last formore than 24 hoursafter the activity.

CFS can also introduce sleep problems, such as:

* feeling unrefreshed after a night’s sleep

* chronic insomnia

* othersleep disorders

In addition, you may also experience:

* loss of memory

* reducedconcentration

* orthostatic intolerance (going from lying or seated to standing positions makes you light-headed, dizzy, or faint)

Physical symptoms of CFS may include:

* muscle pain

* frequentheadaches

* multi-joint pain without redness or swelling

* frequentsore throat

* tender andswollen lymph nodesin your neck and armpits

CFS affects some people in cycles, with periods of feeling worse and then better.

Symptoms may sometimes even disappear completely, which is referred to as remission. However, it’s still possible for symptoms to return later, which is referred to as a relapse.

This cycle of remission and relapse can make it difficult to manage your symptoms, but it’s possible.

## How is CFS diagnosed?

CFS is a very challenging condition to diagnose.

According to theInstitute of Medicine, as of 2015, CFS occurs in about 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans. It’s estimated, however, that 84 to 91 percent have yet to receive a diagnosis.

There are no medical tests to screen for CFS. Its symptoms are similar to many other conditions. Many people with CFS don’t “look sick,” so doctors may not recognize that they indeed have a health condition.

In order to receive a CFS diagnosis, your doctor will rule out other potential causes and review your medical history with you.

They’ll confirm that you at least have the core symptoms previously mentioned. They’ll also ask about the duration and severity of your unexplained fatigue.

Ruling out other potential causes of your fatigue is a key part of the diagnosis process. Some conditions with symptoms that resemble those of CFS include:

* mononucleosis

* Lyme disease

* multiple sclerosis

* lupus (SLE)

* hypothyroidism

* fibromyalgia

* major depressive disorder

* severe obesity

* sleep disorders

The side effects of certain drugs, such asantihistaminesandalcohol, can mimic symptoms of CFS as well.

Because of the similarities between symptoms of CFS and many other conditions, it’s important to not self-diagnose. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. They can work with you to get relief.

## How is CFS treated?

There’s currently no specific cure for CFS.

Each person has different symptoms and therefore may require different types of treatment to manage the disorder and relieve their symptoms.

As mentioned above, some people with CFS may also have functional vitamin deficiencies and theoretically may feel better with vitamin supplementation but much more study is needed.

Work with your team of healthcare providers to create the best treatment plan for you. They can go over the possible benefits and side effects of the therapies with you.

### Addressing post-exertional malaise (PEM) symptoms

PEM occurs when even minor physical, mental, or emotional exertion results in CFS symptoms becoming worse.

Worsening symptoms usually occur12 to 48 hoursafter the activity and last for days or even weeks.

Activity management, also called pacing, can help balance rest and activity to avoid PEM flare-ups. You’ll need to find your individual limits for mental and physical activities, plan these activities, and then rest to stay within these limits.

Some doctors refer to staying within these limits as the “energy envelope.” Keeping a diary of your activities may help you find your personal limits.

It’s important to note that while vigorous aerobic exercise is good for most chronic conditions, people with CFS don’t tolerate such exercise routines.

### Home remedies and lifestyle changes

Making somelifestyle changesmay help reduce your symptoms.

Limiting or eliminating yourcaffeine intakecan help you sleep better and ease your insomnia. You should limit or avoid nicotine and alcohol too.

Try to avoid napping during the day if it’s hurting your ability to sleep at night.

Create asleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night and aim to wake up around the same time every day.

### Medications

Typically, no one medication can treat all of your symptoms. Also, your symptoms may change over time, so your medications may have to as well.

In many cases, CFS can trigger or be a symptom of depression. You may need low-doseantidepressant therapyor a referral to a mental health provider.

If lifestyle changes don’t give you a restful night’s sleep, your doctor may suggest a sleep aid. Pain-reducing medication can also help you cope with aches and joint pain caused by CFS.

If medication therapy is needed, it will have to be tailored for your needs. Work closely with your doctor. There’s no one-size-fits-all treatment for CFS.



### Alternative medicine

Acupuncture, tai chi,yoga, and massage may help relieve the pain associated with CFS. Always talk to your doctor before beginning any alternative or complementary treatments.

## What can be expected in the long term?

Despite increased research efforts, CFS remains a complex condition with no exact known cause and cure. The recovery rate isonly 5%. Managing CFS can therefore be challenging.

You’ll likely need to make lifestyle changes to adapt to your chronic fatigue. As a result, you may experience depression,anxiety, or social isolation. You might find that joining asupport groupcan be helpful as you’re making decisions and transitions.

CFS progresses differently in everyone, so it’s important to work with your doctor to create a treatment plan that meets your needs.

Many people benefit from working with a team of healthcare providers. This can include doctors, therapists, and rehabilitation specialists.

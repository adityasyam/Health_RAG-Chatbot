# Everything You Need to Know About Stress

Stress is a biological response to a perceived threat. It’s caused by chemicals and hormones surging throughout your body. It can help you respond to a particular problem, but too much can harm your health.

Stresstriggers your fight-or-flight response in order to fight the stressor or run away from it. Typically, after the response occurs, your body should relax. Too much constant stress can have negative effects.

### Is all stress bad?

Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s what helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive, and it’s just as important in today’s world. It can be healthy when it helps you avoid an accident, meet a tight deadline, or keep your wits about you amid chaos.

We all feel stressed at times, but what one person finds stressful may be very different from what another finds stressful. An example of this would be public speaking. Some love the thrill of it and others become paralyzed at the very thought.

Stress isn’t always a bad thing, either. Your wedding day, for example, may be considered a good form of stress.

But stress should be temporary. Once you’ve passed the fight-or-flight moment, your heart rate and breathing should slow down and your muscles should relax. In a short time, your body should return to its natural state without any lasting negative effects.

On the other hand, severe, frequent, or prolonged stress can bementally and physically harmful.

And it’s fairly common. When asked,80 percentof Americans reported they’d had at least onesymptom of stressin the past month.Twenty percentreported being under extreme stress.

Life being what it is, it’s not possible to eliminate stress completely. But we can learn to avoid it when possible and manage it when it’s unavoidable.

## Defining stress

Stress is a normal biological reaction to a potentially dangerous situation. When you encounter sudden stress, your brain floods your body with chemicals and hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.

That gets your heart beating faster and sends blood to muscles and important organs. You feel energized and have heightened awareness so you can focus on your immediate needs.These are the different stages of stress and how people adapt.

## Stress hormones

When you sense danger, thehypothalamusat the base of your brain reacts. It sends nerve and hormone signals to youradrenal glands, which release an abundance of hormones.

These hormones are nature’s way of preparing you to face danger and increase your chances of survival.

One of these hormones is adrenaline. You might also know it as epinephrine, or the fight-or-flight hormone. In rapid fashion, adrenaline works to:

* increase your heartbeat

* increase your breathing rate

* make it easier for your muscles to useglucose

* contract blood vessels so blood is directed to the muscles

* stimulate perspiration

* inhibitinsulinproduction

While this is helpful in the moment, frequent adrenaline surges can lead to:

* damaged blood vessels

* high blood pressure, or hypertension

* higher risk ofheart attackandstroke

* headaches

* anxiety

* insomnia

* weight gain

Here’s what else you should know about an adrenaline rush.

Although adrenaline is important, it isn’t the primary stress hormone. That’s cortisol.

## Stress and cortisol

As the main stress hormone, cortisol plays an essential role in stressful situations. Among its functions are:

* raising the amount of glucose in your bloodstream

* helping the brain use glucose more effectively

* raising the accessibility of substances that help with tissue repair

* restraining functions that are nonessential in a life-threatening situation

* altering immune system response

* dampening the reproductive system and growth process

* affecting parts of the brain that control fear, motivation, and mood

All this helps you deal more effectively with a high-stress situation. It’s a normal process and crucial to human survival.

But if your cortisol levels stay high for too long, it has a negative impact on your health. It can contribute to:

* weight gain

* high blood pressure

* sleep problems

* lack of energy

* type 2 diabetes

* osteoporosis

* mental cloudiness (brain fog) and memory problems

* a weakened immune system, leaving you more vulnerable to infections

It can also have a negative impact on your mood.You can lower your cortisol levels naturally: Here’s how.

## Types of stress

There are severaltypes of stress, including:

* acute stress

* episodic acute stress

* chronic stress

### Acute stress

Acute stress happens to everyone. It’s the body’s immediate reaction to a new and challenging situation. It’s the kind of stress you might feel when you narrowly escape a car accident.

Acute stress can also come out of something that you actually enjoy. It’s the somewhat-frightening, yet thrilling feeling you get on a roller coaster or when skiing down a steep mountain slope.

These incidents of acute stress don’t normally do you any harm. They might even be good for you. Stressful situations give your body and brain practice in developing the best response to future stressful situations.

Once the danger passes, your body systems should return to normal.

Severe acute stressis a different story. This kind of stress, such as when you’ve faced a life-threatening situation, can lead topost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)or other mental health problems.

### Episodic acute stress

Episodic acute stress is when you have frequent episodes of acute stress.

This might happen if you’re often anxious and worried about things you suspect may happen. You might feel that your life is chaotic and you seemingly go from one crisis to the next.

Certain professions, such as law enforcement or firefighters, might also lead to frequent high-stress situations.

As with severe acute stress, episodic acute stress can affect your physical health and mental well-being.

### Chronic stress

When you have high-stress levels for an extended period of time, you have chronic stress. Long-term stress like this can have a negative impact on your health. It may contribute to:

* anxiety

* cardiovascular disease

* depression

* high blood pressure

* a weakened immune system

Chronic stress can also lead to frequent ailments such as headaches, an upset stomach, and sleep difficulties.Gaining insights into the different types of stress and how to recognize them may help.

## Causes of stress

Some typicalcauses of acute or chronic stressinclude:

* living through a natural or manmade disaster

## Stress eating

Some people react to stress by eating, even if they’re not hungry. If you find yourself eating without thinking,binging in the middle of the night, or generallyeating way morethan you used to, you might be stress eating.

When you stress eat, you take in a lot more calories than you need and you’re probably not choosing the healthiest foods. This can lead torapid weight gainand a host of health problems. And it does nothing to resolve your stress.

## Stress at work

Work can be a source of great stress for any number of reasons. This kind of stress can be occasional or chronic.

Stress at work can come in the form of:

* feeling you lack power or control over what happens

* feeling stuck in a job you dislike and seeing no alternatives

* being made to do things you don’t think you should do

* experiencing a conflict with a co-worker

* having too much asked of you, orbeing overworked

If you’re in a job you hate or are always responding to others’ demands without any control, stress seems unavoidable. Sometimes, quitting or fighting for more work-life balance is the right thing to do.This is how to know you’re headed for burnout at work.

Of course, some jobs are just more dangerous than others. Some, such as emergency first-responders, call for you to put your life on the line. Then, there are professions — such as ones in the medical field, like a doctor or nurse — where you hold someone else’s life in your hands. Finding balance and managing your stress is important to maintain your mental health.

## Stress and anxiety

Stress and anxietyoften go hand in hand. Stress comes from the demands placed on your brain and body. Anxiety is when you feel high levels of worry, unease, or fear.

Anxietycan certainly be an offshoot of episodic or chronic stress.

Having both stress and anxiety can have a severe negative impact on your health, making you more likely to develop:

* high blood pressure

* heart disease

* diabetes

* panic disorder

* depression

Stress and anxiety can be treated. In fact, there are many strategies and resources that can help for both.

Start by seeing your primary doctor, who can check your overall health and refer you for counseling. If you’ve thought about harming yourself or others, get help immediately.

## Stress management

In order to manage your stress, first you have to identify the things that cause you stress — or your triggers. Figure out which of these things can be avoided. Then, find ways to cope with those negative stressors that can’t be avoided.

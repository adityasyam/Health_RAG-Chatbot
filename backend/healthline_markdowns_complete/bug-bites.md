# Identifying Bug Bites and Stings, and How to Treat Them

The initial contact of a bite or sting from a bug may be painful. It is often followed by an allergic reaction to venom deposited into your skin through the mouth or stinger of the bug. The appearance can vary.

Whether you’re in the water, on a mountain trail, or in your backyard, wildlife you encounter have ways of protecting themselves and their territory.

Insects, such as bees, ants, spiders, and scorpions, may bite or sting if you get close. Most of these animals won’t bother you if you don’t bother them, but knowing what to look for is key.

Most bites and stings trigger nothing more than minor discomfort, but some encounters can be deadly, especially if you have severe allergies to the animal’s venom.

A severe allergic reaction can happen with any bug bite or sting, depending on the person. Venom allergies may cause a dangerous, severe allergic reaction in some people, resulting in swelling, generalized itching, and difficulty breathing.

Prevention is the best medicine, so knowing how to recognize and avoid biting and stinging insects or arachnids is the best way to stay safe.

### Signs of an emergency

Anaphylaxis can be a life threatening emergency. If someone experiences signs of a severe allergic reaction, call 911 or your local emergency services. Anaphylaxis can cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, choking sensation, wheezing, abdominal pain, dizziness, or fainting. This can be fatal if it isn’t treated immediately.

## Pictures of bites and stings

The form a bite takes depends onwhat typeof animal bit you. Take a look at the photos below to help identify which animal may have caused your bug bite.

Warning: Graphic images ahead.

### Mosquito bites

* Amosquito biteis a small, round, puffy bump that appears soon after you’ve been bitten.

* The bump will become discolored, hard, swollen, and itchy.

* You may have multiple bites in the same area.

### Fire ant stings

* Fire ants are small, aggressive, red or black venomous ants that bite and then deliverpainful stings.

* Stings appear as swollen spots that develop a blister on top.

* Stings can burn and itch.

### Flea bites

* Flea bitesare usually located in clusters on the lower legs and feet.

* The itchy bumps are surrounded by a discolored halo.

* Symptoms begin immediately after you’re bitten.

### Bedbug bites

* The itchy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to the bedbug bite.

* The small rashes have red, swollen areas and dark red centers.

* Bites may appear in a line or grouped together, usually on areas of the body not covered by clothing, such as the hands, neck, or feet.

* There may be very itchy blisters or hives at the bite site.

### Fly bites

* Painful, itchy rashes are caused by an inflammatory reaction at the site of the fly bite.

* Though usually harmless, they may lead to severe allergic reactions or spread insect-borne diseases.

* It is important to take precautions when traveling to endemic countries by wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and by using bug spray.

### Lice bites

* Headlice, pubic lice (“crabs”), and body lice are different species of parasitic lice that affect humans.

* They feed on blood and cause an itchy immune reaction at the site of their bites.

* Adult lice are gray/tan six-legged insects about the size of a tiny sesame seed.

* Nits (eggs) and nymphs (baby lice) can only be seen as very tiny specks that may look like dandruff.

### Chigger bites

* Painful, itchy rashes may be caused by an immune response to the bites of tiny mite larvae.

* Bites appear as welts, blisters, pimples, or hives.

* Bites will generally appear in groups and are extremely itchy.

* Chigger bites may be grouped in skin folds or near areas where clothing fits tightly.

* Chiggers tend to jump from grass, so bites are usually on legs near the tops of socks.

### Tick bites

* Bites can cause pain or swelling at the bite area.

* Theymay also lead toa rash, a burning sensation, blisters, or difficulty breathing.

* The tick often remains attached to the skin for a long time.

* Bites rarely appear in groups.

### Scabies

* Symptoms caused byscabies mitesmay take4 to 6 weeksto appear.

* The extremely itchy rash may be pimply, made up of tiny blisters, or scales.

* They may cause raised, white, or flesh-toned lines.

### Spider bites

### This condition is considered a medical emergency, and 911 or local emergency services should be contacted. Urgent care may be required.

* Most spiders don’t pose a threat to humans, and in such cases, their bites are harmless or mildly irritating like a bee sting.

* Dangerous spiders include the brown recluse, black widow, funnel web spider (Australia), and wandering spider (South America).

* A single raised papule, pustule, or wheal may appear at the site of the bite followed by redness and tenderness.

* Thebitewill appear as two small puncture marks.

* Severe allergic reactions to a spider bite may require medical attention.

### Brown recluse spider bite

* This is a brown- or tan-colored spider with a violin-shaped patch and six paired eyes, two in the front and two sets of two on either side of the head.

* It likes to hide in quiet, dark places like closets and bookshelves and is native to the South and South Central regions of the United States.

* It is deemed non-aggressive and will only bite humans if it’s being crushed between the skin and a hard surface.

* It may cause redness or other color changes with a central blister at the site of the bite.

* Rare complications include fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting,hemolytic anemia,rhabdomyolysis, andkidney failure.

### Black widow spider bite

* Abite from a black widow spider causes a sharp pain, like a pin prick. This is followed by dull, sometimes numbing pain around the site.

* This spider is plump, black, and shiny, with an hourglass-shaped red mark on its abdomen.

* It’s nonaggressive and will only bite if it’s being crushed.

* Muscle pain and cramping can often develop within a few hours.

* You should seek medical attention if symptoms extend beyond the bite site.

### Hobo spider bite

* The venom of this common household spiderisn’t considered toxic to humans.

* Bites are generally harmless and cause only minor pain, swelling, and sometimes muscle twitches.

* A single disclored area appears with a tender central nodule.

* Itching, burning, or stinging may occur at the site of the bite.

### Wolf spider bite

* This large (up to two inches long), fuzzy, gray/brown spider is native to many parts of the United States.

* It is typically nonaggressive, but will bite if it feels threatened.

### Horsefly bites

* These large (one-inch long) blood-sucking flies are most active in the daylight hours.

* An instant, sharp burning sensation occurs when a horsefly bites.

* Itchiness, swelling, and bruising may also occur at the bite location.

### Bee stings

* Pain, discoloration, swelling, or itching occurs at the site of the sting.

* Unlike bumblebees and carpenter bees, honeybees can only sting once due to their barbed stinger that can remain in the skin.

### Yellow jacket stings

* These thin wasps have black and yellow stripes and long dark wings.

* Aggressive, a yellow jacket may sting multiple times.

* Swelling, tenderness, itchiness, or discoloration may occur near the area that’s been stung.

### Wasp stings

* Sharp pain, swelling, and itching or burning occurs at the sting site.

* A raised welt appears around the sting site.

* Wasps can be aggressive and are capable of stinging multiple times.

### Scorpion stings

* Scorpions are eight-legged arachnids with large pincers and long, segmented, stinger-tipped tails carried in a forward curve over their backs.

* Many species with variable levels of toxicity can be found all over the world.

* Intense pain, tingling, numbness, and swelling occur around the sting.

* Rare symptoms include breathing difficulties, muscle twitching, vomiting, restlessness, and excitability.

* Severe symptoms are more likely in infants and children than adults.

### Kissing bug bites

* Triatomine bugs, also calledkissing bugs, tend to bite people on the face or near the mouth.

* These bugs tend to reside in Mexico, Central America, South America, and parts of the United States.

* They carry a parasite calledTrypanosoma cruziand canT. cruziinfection andChagas disease.

* While there are different varieties of kissing bugs, they typically have a cone-shaped head and a long, oval-shaped body with antennae and six legs. They can be light brown to black in color and may have yellow, red, or tan markings.

* Bite reactions may include mild itching, discoloration, and swelling. With aT. cruziinfection, a small hard area may form at the bite site.

### Deer fly bites

* Deer flies have small, round heads, brownish-black bands on their wings, and gold or green eyes.

* Their bites can be painful and cause bumps or welts.

* Their bites can sometimes cause a rare bacterial disease known astularemia (rabbit fever)that may cause skin ulcers, fever, and headache.

## Types of biting and stinging insects and arachnids

Here are some bugs that can be more dangerous than others:

* spiders, such asbrown recluse spiders,black widow spiders, and mouse spiders

* stinging insects, such asbees, paper wasps (hornets), andyellow jackets

* scorpions, such as the Arizona bark scorpion

Many larger insects and other bugs won’t seek you out but will bite if handled.

## Who is at risk of bites and stings?

Anyone can be bitten or stung by an insect or arachnid, and bites and stings are very common. You’re at greater risk if you spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in rural or wooded locations.

Children and older adults may have more severe reactions to bites and stings.

## What are the symptoms of a bad reaction to bites and stings?

If you’re bitten or stung, you may see or feel the animal on your skin during the attack. Some people don’t notice the animal and may not be aware of a bite or sting until one or more of the following symptoms emerge:

* swelling

* rash

* pain in the affected area or in the muscles

* itching

* heat on and around the site of the bite or sting

* numbness or tingling in the affected area

Symptoms of a severe reaction requiring immediate medical treatment include:

* fever

* difficulty breathing

* nausea or vomiting

* muscle spasms

* rapid heart rate

* swelling of the lips and throat

* confusion

* loss of consciousness

If you feel ill or experience flu-like symptoms in the days following an insect or arachnid bite, see a doctor for tests to rule out infections or diseases you may have contracted from the animal.

## Diagnosing bites and stings

Many people are aware they’ve been bitten or stung because they see the insect or arachnid shortly after the attack.

Although you shouldn’t further provoke an attacking insect or arachnid, try to preserve the animal if it dies following the bite or sting. This may help a doctor properly diagnose your symptoms.

This is especially important for a spider bite, as some species have dangerously potent venom.

## Treating bites and stings

The majority of bites and stings can be treated at home, especially if your reaction is mild.

To treat a bite or sting:

* Remove the stingerif it’s lodged in your skin by using your fingernail or a piece of gauze to scrape over it. Avoid using tweezers, as this can cause more venom to deposit into your skin.

* Wash the affected area.

* Apply an ice pack to reduce pain and swelling.

Topical anti-itch creams,oral pain relievers, andantihistaminescan be used to combat uncomfortable symptoms.

You may also want to consider applying a thin paste of baking soda and water to the sting to calm the itching.

Call 911 or your local emergency services number immediately if symptoms of a severe reaction are present.

First aid instructions while waiting for paramedics to arrive include:

* loosening the person’s clothing

* laying them on their side

* performing CPRif breathing or the heartbeat stops

If you believe a spider of the black widow or brown recluse variety has bitten you, contact 911 or local emergency services immediately even if symptoms seem minor or haven’t emerged.

Scorpion and spider bites should betreated as an emergency. You should seek immediate medical attention when symptoms are felt beyond the location of the bite.

## The bottom line

Most bites and stings heal by themselves after several days of mild discomfort.

It is important to monitor the affected site for signs of infection. and contact a doctor if the wound appears to be getting worse or hasn’t healed after several weeks.

Bites and stings that cause severe reactions can be fatal if they aren’t treated immediately.

Once you’ve experienced a severe allergic reaction, a doctor will likely prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector. Epinephrine is a hormone that can prevent anaphylactic shock.

You should carry the auto-injector with you at all times to reverse the reaction immediately following a bite or sting.

Menopause officially begins when you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without menstruating. Symptoms like night sweats are common right before, during, and after menopause. Treatment can help alleviate your symptoms and maintain your quality of life.

Menopause occurs when 12 or more months have passed since your last menstrual period. Although many people experience menopause in their early 50s, this transition can happen earlier in life.

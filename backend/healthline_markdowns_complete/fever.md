# Everything You Need to Know About Fever

## Overview

Fever is also known as hyperthermia, pyrexia, or elevated temperature. It describes a body temperature that’s higher than normal. Fever can affect children and adults.

A short-term increase in body temperature can help your body fight off illness. However, a severe fever can be a symptom of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

## What to look for

Recognizing a fever can enable you to get treatment and proper monitoring for it. Normal body temperature is typically around 98.6°F (37°C). However, the normal body temperature for each person can vary slightly.

Normal body temperature may also fluctuate depending on the time of day. It tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.

Other factors, such as yourmenstrual cycleor intense exercise, can also affect body temperature.

To check you or your child’s temperature, you can use an oral, rectal, or axillary thermometer.

An oral thermometer should be placed under the tongue for three minutes.

Shop for oral thermometers.

You may also use an oral thermometer for an axillary, or armpit, reading. Simply place the thermometer in the armpit and cross your arms or your child’s arms over the chest. Wait four to five minutes before removing the thermometer.

A rectal thermometer may be used for measuring body temperature in infants. To do this:

* Place a small amount of petroleum jelly on the bulb.

* Lay your baby on their stomach and gently insert the thermometer about 1 inch into their rectum.

* Hold the bulb and your baby still for at least three minutes.

Find a selection of rectal thermometers online.

In general, a baby has a fever when their body temperature exceeds 100.4°F (38°C). A child has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99.5°F (37.5°C). An adult has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99–99.5°F (37.2–37.5°C).

## What usually causes a fever?

Fever occurs when a part of the brain called thehypothalamusshifts the set point of your normal body temperature upward. When this happens, you may feel chilled and add layers of clothing, or you may startshiveringto generate more body heat. This eventually results in a higher body temperature.

There are numerous different conditions that can trigger a fever. Some possible causes include:

* infections, including thefluandpneumonia

* some immunizations, such asdiphtheria or tetanus(in children)

* teething(in infants)

* some inflammatory diseases, includingrheumatoid arthritis (RA)andCrohn’s disease

* blood clots

* extreme sunburn

* food poisoning

* some medications, includingantibiotics

Depending on the cause of the fever, additional symptoms may include:

* sweating

* shivering

* headache

* muscle aches

* loss of appetite

* dehydration

* generalweakness

## How to treat a fever at home

Care for a fever depends on its severity. A low-grade fever with no other symptoms doesn’t typically require medical treatment. Drinking fluids and resting in bed are usually enough to fight off a fever.

When a fever is accompanied by mild symptoms, such as general discomfort or dehydration, it can be helpful to treat elevated body temperature by:

* making sure the room temperature where the person is resting is comfortable

* taking a regular bath or a sponge bath using lukewarm water

* takingacetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil)

* drinking plenty of fluids

* Show your children how towash their hands properly. Instruct them to cover both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinse thoroughly under warm water.

* Carry hand sanitizer or antibacterial wipes with you. They can come in handy when you don’t have access to soap and water. Findhand sanitizersandantibacterial wipesonline.

* Avoid touching your nose, mouth, or eyes. Doing so makes it easier for viruses and bacteria to enter your body and cause infection.

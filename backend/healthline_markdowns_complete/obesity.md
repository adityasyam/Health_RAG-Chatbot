# Obesity: What You Need to Know

Obesity is a long-term (chronic) health condition that progresses over time. Obesity is defined by excess body fat (adipose tissue) that may impair health.

Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that takes a person’s weight and height into account to measure body size. Doctors typically use it as a screening tool for obesity.

In adults, obesity is often defined as having aBMIof30 or more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing serious diseases, including:

* type 2 diabetes

* heart disease

* cancer

While BMI tends to relate to the level of body fat, it has some limitations as a measurement.

According to theCDC, “Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the relationship between BMI and body fat. Also, BMI doesn’t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it provide any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.”

Despite these limitations, BMI continues to be widely used as a way to measure body size. This is because it’s less expensive than other methods.

It’s worth noting that the effects ofweight discriminationcan also contribute to negative health effects.

Obesity is common. The CDC estimates that41.9%of people in the United States had obesity from 2017 to March 2020.

### Language matters

You’ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating between the use of “men” and “women.”

Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings.

Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn’t report data on, or include, participants who were transgender,nonbinary,gender nonconforming,genderqueer,agender, or genderless.

## What are the symptoms of obesity?

There are no specific symptoms associated with obesity. A doctor may diagnose obesity based on the following factors:

* excess amounts of abdominal (visceral) fat that are higher than the amounts of body fat in other areas

* a waist circumference of greater than40 inches for men or 35 inches for women

* a BMIover 30

## How is obesity classified?

The followingclassesare used for adults who are at least 20 years old:

### What is childhood obesity?

For a doctor to diagnose obesity in achild over 2 years old or a teen, their BMI has to be at or above the95th percentile. A BMI at or above the 95th percentile is higher than the BMI of 95% of people with the same age and sex assigned at birth.

From 2015 to 2016,18.5%(or about 13.7 million) of U.S. youth between 2 and 19 years old were considered to have clinical obesity.

## What causes obesity?

Taking in more calories than you burnin daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain.

But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control.

Common specific causes of obesityinclude:

* genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored

* growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight

* not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods

* high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat

* pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity

Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include:

* metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions

* polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes animbalanceof hormones called androgens

* Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger

* Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by havinghigh levels of cortisol(the stress hormone) in your system

* hypothyroidism(underactive thyroid), a condition in which thethyroid glanddoesn’t produce enough of certain important hormones

* osteoarthritis (OA)and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity

## Who is at risk of obesity?

A complex mix of factors can increase a person’s risk of obesity.

### Genetics

Some people have genes that make it more likely for them to gain weight and body fat.

### Environment and community

Your environment at home, at school, and in your community can all influence how and what you eat, as well as how active you are.

You may be at a higher risk of developing obesity if you:

* live in a neighborhood withlimited nutritious food optionsor withmanyhigh calorie food options, like fast-food restaurants

* haven’t learned to cook balanced meals

* think you can’t afford more nutritious foods

* haven’t founda good place to play, walk, or exercise in your neighborhood

### Psychological and other factors

Depressioncan sometimes lead to weight gain, as some people may turn to food for emotional comfort.

Having disturbed sleeping patternscan make you eat moreduring the day, especially foods high in fat and carbohydrates.

If you smoke,quitting smokingis beneficial to your health, but quitting may lead to weight gain too. In some people, it may lead toexcessiveweight gain. For that reason, it’s important to focus on diet and exercise while you’re quitting, at least after the initial withdrawal period.

### Medications

Certain medications can also raise your risk of weight gain. These medications can include:

* corticosteroids, which may treat autoimmune disease

* antidepressants

* antipsychotics

* beta-blockers, which may treat high blood pressure

## How is obesity diagnosed?

BMI provides a rough calculation of a person’s weight in relation to their height.

Other more accurate measures ofbody fatand where body fat is located include:

* skinfold thickness tests

* waist-to-hip comparisons

* dual energy radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA) scans

* other screening tests, such asultrasounds,CT scans, andMRI scans

A doctor may also order certain tests to help diagnose obesity-related health risks. These may include:

* blood teststo examinecholesterolandglucoselevels

* liver function tests

* diabetes screening

* thyroid tests

* heart tests, such as anelectrocardiogram(ECG or EKG)

A measurement ofthe fat around your waistis also a good predictor of your risk of developing obesity-related diseases.

## What are the complications of obesity?

Obesity can lead to more than weight gain.

Having a high ratio of body fat to muscle puts strain on your bones as well as your internal organs. It also increasesinflammationin the body, which may be a risk factor for cancer. Obesity is also amajor risk factorfor type 2 diabetes.

Researchers have linked obesity to manyhealth complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated:

* type 2 diabetes

* heart disease

* high blood pressure

* certain cancers (breast,colon, andendometrial)

* stroke

* gallbladder disease

* fatty liver disease

* high cholesterol

* sleep apneaand other breathing problems

* arthritis

* infertility

## How is obesity treated?

If you have obesity and would like to lose weight but have been unable to do so on your own, medical help is available. Start with aprimary care physician, who may be able to refer you to a weight specialist in your area.

A doctor may also want to work with you aspart of a teamhelping you lose weight. That team might include adietitian,therapist, or other healthcare staff.

The doctor will work with you on making needed lifestyle changes. Sometimes, they may recommend medications or weight loss surgery as well.Learn more about treatment for obesity.

Doctors typically recommend lifestyle and behavioral changes to help children with obesity lose weight. In some cases, doctorsmay prescribemedication.

## Which lifestyle and behavioral changes can help with weight loss?

A healthcare team can recommend food choices and help developa nutritious eating planthat works for you. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseasessuggeststhat an eating plan that you can stick to long-term may help you lose weight and maintain a moderate weight.

A structured exercise program andincreased daily activity— between150 and 300 minutesa week — will help build up your strength,endurance, andmetabolism.

Counseling orsupport groupsmay also identify triggers and help you cope with issues relating to:

* anxiety

* depression

* emotional eating

## Which medications are prescribed for weight loss?

A doctor may also prescribe certain prescription weight loss medications in addition to eating and exercise plans.

Doctors may prescribe medications if other methods of weight loss haven’t worked and if you have a BMI of 27 or more in addition to obesity-related health issues.

Prescription weight loss medications either prevent the absorption of fat or suppress appetite. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications for short-term use (up to 12 weeks):

* phentermine/topiramate(Qsymia)

* naltrexone/bupropion(Contrave)

* liraglutide (Saxenda)

* semaglutide (Ozempic,Wegovy,Rybelsus)

* orlistat (Alli, Xenical), the only one that’s FDA-approved for use inchildren 12 years old and older

These drugs may have unpleasant side effects for some people but may have more serious side effects for others. For example, orlistat can lead to the unpleasant side effects of oily and frequent bowel movements, bowel urgency, and gas. But liraglutide and semaglutide may increase the risk ofthyroid cancerfor people with a personal or family history.

It’s important to inform the prescribing doctor about your medical history before beginning any of these medications. The doctor will typically monitor you closely to manage side effects and reduce your risks.

## What are the types of weight loss surgery?

Weight loss surgery is commonly called bariatric surgery.

This type of surgery limits how much food you can comfortably eat or prevents your body from absorbing food and calories. Sometimes it can do both.

Weight loss surgery isn’t a quick fix. It’s a major surgery and can have serious risks. Afterward, people who undergo surgery will need to change how they eat and how much they eat, or they risk getting sick.

However, nonsurgical options aren’t always effective at helping people with obesity lose weight and reduce their risk of comorbidities.

Types of weight loss surgery include:

* Gastric bypass surgery:In thisprocedure, a surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach that connects directly to your small intestine. Food and liquids go through the pouch and into the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. It’s also known as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery.

* Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB):LAGB separates your stomach into two pouches using a band.

* Gastric sleeve surgery:Thisprocedureremoves part of your stomach.

* Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch:This procedure removes most of your stomach.

### Candidates for surgery

For decades, experts recommended that adult candidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of at least 35 (classes 2 and 3).

However, in 2018 guidelines, theAmerican Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS)endorsed weight loss surgery for adults with BMIs of 30 up to 35 (class 1) who:

* have related comorbidities, especially type 2 diabetes

* haven’t seen long-term results from nonsurgical treatments, such as eating and lifestyle changes

For individuals with class 1 obesity, surgery is most effective for thosebetween the ages of 18 and 65 years.

Some people may have to lose weight before surgery can be approved. Additionally, they’ll normally undergo counseling to ensure that they’re both emotionally prepared for the surgery and the lifestyle changes that it’ll require.

Only a few surgical centers in the United States perform these types of procedures on children under 18 years old.

## How can you prevent obesity?

Due to a dramatic increase in obesity and obesity-related diseases, communities, states, and the federal government are putting an emphasis on healthierfood choicesandactivitiesto help prevent obesity and treat people with overweight and obesity.

On a personal level, you can helpprevent weight gain and obesityby:

* getting regular moderate exerciselikewalking,swimming, orbikingfor 20 to 30 minutes every day

* eating a balanced, heart-healthy dietcomposed of nutritious foods, likefruits,vegetables,whole grains, andlean protein

* eating high calorie foods and those high insaturated and trans fatsin moderation

## Takeaway

Obesity is a chronic medical condition caused by excess visceral fat. It may raise your risk of developing multiple health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.

Treatment can include lifestyle changes and medication. In some cases, it can involve surgery.

# Erectile Dysfunction (ED): Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment

Erectile dysfunction can become more prevalent with age. However, symptoms can be treated with medication, therapy, and other methods.

## What is erectile dysfunction? Defining what ED means

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get or keep an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse. It’s sometimes referred to as “impotence,” but this term is now used less often.

ED can occur because of problems at any stage of theerectionprocess, and it can be occasional or frequent:

* Occasional ED isn’t uncommon. Many people experience it during times of stress or as the result of a recent nutritional or lifestyle change.

* Frequent ED, however, can be a sign of health problems that need treatment. It can also be a symptom of emotional or relationship difficulties that you may want to address with a professional.

## Erectile dysfunction causes

There are many possible causes of ED, and they can include both emotional and physical conditions. Common physical causes include:

* cardiovascular disease

* diabetes

* hypertension, or high blood pressure

* high cholesterol

* hypothyroidism

* obesity

* low testosterone levelsor otherhormone imbalances

* kidney disease

* increased age

* relationship problems

* certain prescription medications, such as those used to treathigh blood pressureordepression

* sleep disorders

* drug use

* consuming too muchalcohol

* liver cirrhosis

* epilepsy

* usingtobaccoproducts

* Parkinson’s disease

* multiple sclerosis

* damage to the pelvic area through injury or surgery

* Peyronie’s disease, which causes scar tissue to develop in the penis

Common emotional causes include:

* stress

* anxiety

* depression

* performance anxiety

* relationship problems

ED can be caused by only one of these factors or by several of them. That’s why it’s important to work with your doctor so that they can rule out or treat any underlying medical conditions.Learn more about the causes of ED.

## Erectile dysfunction symptoms

Trouble getting an erectionand difficulty maintaining an erection during sexual activities are the most common symptoms of erectile dysfunction.

Other sexual disorders related to ED include:

* premature ejaculation

* delayed ejaculation

* anorgasmia, or the inability to achieve orgasm after ample stimulation

Speak with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they’ve lasted for 3 or more months. They can help determine whether your symptoms are caused by an underlying condition that requires treatment.

## How common is erectile dysfunction? Exploring the prevalence of ED

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,around 30 million U.S. menhave ED.

The prevalence of ED increases with age. The University of Wisconsin estimates that mild or moderate ED affects10% more men for each decade of life. For example, 60% of men in their 60s might experience some form of ED.

However, ED can also occur amongyounger people. One2013 studyfound that 1 in 4 men seeking their first treatment for ED was under 40 years old. Researchers observed a stronger correlation betweensmoking, drug use, and ED in these men when compared with older men. This suggests that lifestyle choices are an important factor for ED in younger men.

Although the risk of ED increases with age, ED isn’t inevitable. In general, the healthier you are, the better your sexual function.Learn more about aging and ED.

If you have diabetes, work with your doctor tomanage your blood sugar levels. This can help prevent damage that can lead to ED.Explore the connection between ED and type 2 diabetes.

## Can I get tested for ED? Receiving a diagnosis for ED

Testing for EDcan involve a variety of steps, including a physical examination and examining your health and sexual history. Your doctor may order additional tests to determine if your symptoms are caused by an underlying condition.

### Physical exam

* check nerve function in the pelvic region

They may also recommend arectal examto check yourprostate.

### Psychosocial history

Your doctor will ask you questions or request that you fill out a questionnaire about your symptoms, health history, and sexual history. The responses can help them evaluate the severity of your ED.

Some questions that they may ask include:

* How long have you been experiencing ED? Did it come on suddenly or gradually?

* Are you having any problems withfeeling sexual desire,ejaculating, orreaching orgasm?

* How often do you have sex? Has this frequency changed recently?

* How firm are your erections? Is this affected by particular situations or types of stimulation?

* Do you wake upin the morningor in the middle of the night with erections?

* How’s your current relationship? What expectations do you and your partner have for each other? Have there been any changes?

* Have you recently been experiencing a lot of stress?

* What medications are you currently taking? Do you use tobacco, alcohol, or nonprescription drugs?

* Do you have any underlying conditions or have you had any surgery on or injury to yourpelvic area?

### Additional tests

Your doctor may perform additional testing to help diagnose your ED. Tests can include:

* Ultrasound:Anultrasoundcan be used to examine theblood vessels of the penisto determine if there’s a problem with penile blood flow.

* Nocturnal penile tumescence test:A portable, battery-powered device is used to evaluate the quality of your nocturnal erections. The device is worn on the thigh. It stores data your doctor can access later. However, it’s not used as often today as it had been in the past.

* Injection test:During this test, a medication is injected into your penis to stimulate an erection. This allows your doctor to evaluate the firmness of the erection and how long it lasts. This type of test can also be combined with ultrasound to further asses the erection.

* Urine tests:Urine testscan check fordiabetesor other underlying health conditions.

* Blood tests:Blood testscan check for conditions such as diabetes, heart disease,thyroid issues, andlow levels of testosterone.

These tests can help your doctor guide your treatment as well as determine if an underlying condition may be causing your ED.Find out more about how blood tests can help diagnose ED.

## Erectile dysfunction treatments

Treatment for ED will depend on the underlying cause. You may need to use a combination of treatments, including medication or talk therapy.

### Medications

Your doctor may prescribe medication to help you manage the symptoms of ED. You may need to try several medications before you find one that works. The followingoral medicationsstimulate blood flow to your penis to help treat ED:

* avanafil (Stendra)

* sildenafil(Viagra)

* tadalafil(Cialis)

* vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn)

Alprostadil (Caverject, Edex, MUSE) is another medication that can be used to treat ED. It can be administered in two ways: as a penile suppository, or as a self-injection at the base or side of the penis.

In most cases, however, alprostadil is not used alone as an injection, and the combination drug Trimix (alprostadil, phentolamine, papaverine) is used instead.

Your doctor may recommendtestosterone replacement therapy (TRT)if you have low levels of testosterone.

Medications used for other conditions may cause ED as well. Talk with your doctor about your medications and whether they could be causing ED symptoms.

Your doctor may be able to prescribe other medications. It is also important to note that you should not stop taking any prescribed medications without first talking with your doctor.

Medications for ED can causeside effectsor interact badly with any medications you may already be taking. If you’re experiencing unpleasant side effects, talk with your doctor. They may be able to recommend adifferent medication.

Additionally, some cardiac medications can have very serious side effects if taken with some ED medications. For this reason, it’s very important to share with your doctor the names and dosages of every medication you’re taking before beginning anything new.

If ED isaffecting your relationship, consider speaking with a relationship counselor as well. Relationship counseling can help you and your partner reconnect emotionally, which may also help your ED.Explore the effects of stress and anxiety on ED.

### Vacuum pumps

This treatment uses the creation of a vacuum to stimulate an erection. Using the device draws blood into the penis, leading to an erection.

A vacuum pump device consists of a few different components:

* a plastic tube, which you place over your penis

* a pump, which works to create a vacuum by drawing air out of the plastic tube

* anelastic ring, which you’ll move to the base of your penis as you remove the plastic tube

The elastic ring functions to maintain the erection, holding the blood in the penis and preventing it from returning to circulation. You can leave it in place for 30 minutes.

## Can I order ED medications like Viagra and Cialis online?

Since ED medications like Cialis and Viagra require prescriptions, you will need to talk with a doctor in order to purchase these medications online. Thankfully, many reputable online services can connect you with a prescribing doctor or medical professional and ship your ED medications directly to your home.

## Alternative ways to manage erectile dysfunction

### Exercises for erectile dysfunction

Certain exercises can also help with ED.

Kegel exercisesare simple movements you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Here’s how:

* Identify your pelvic floor muscles. To do this, stop peeing midstream. The muscles you use to do this are your pelvic floor muscles.

* Now that you know where these muscles are, contract them for 3 seconds. Then release them.

* Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times in a row, three times per day.

A small2005 studycompared two groups of men with ED. The first group of men performed regular pelvic floor muscle exercises with a physiotherapist. They also receivedbiofeedbackand advice on lifestyle changes. The second group only received advice on lifestyle changes.

Men in the first group saw their penile function improve significantly after 3 months of regular pelvic floor muscle exercises. Men in the second group saw little improvement after 3 months.

For the next 3 months, all participants were given at-home exercises to perform. After 6 months in total, 40% of all participants, including some men who had belonged to the second group, had regained normal erectile function.

A2019 literature reviewalso concluded that pelvic floor exercises were effective at treating both ED and premature ejaculation. However, the researchers didn’t identify an ideal exercise plan in terms of conditions such as frequency and intensity.

You may find that it’s easier initially to do Kegels while lying down. Eventually, you can start trying them when you’re sitting or standing.

Moderate to vigorous exercise is not only good for your overall health. It also can increase blood flow, possibly helping with ED. Examples include running andswimming.

A2018 review of 10 studiesexamined the effect of aerobic exercise on ED. From their review, investigators concluded that 160 minutes of weekly exercise for 6 months could lead to a decrease in erectile problems.

Another2018 studyexamined physical fitness and testosterone levels in 87 men with ED. Researchers found that testosterone levels were negatively correlated with levels ofbody fatandabdominal fat. This suggests that exercise may increase testosterone in addition to reducing body fat.

Before you start a new exercise plan, always discuss it with your doctor. This is particularly important for people with heart disease or another underlying condition that could be aggravated by vigorous activity.Learn more about exercise and ED.

Yogacan help to relax your mind and body. Since stress or anxiety can cause or contribute to ED, practicing yoga may be an effective way to ease ED symptoms.

In fact, an older2010 studyof 65 men between 24 and 60 years old found that sexual function increased significantly after a 12-week program of yoga sessions.Discover five yoga poses that could help with ED.

### Foods for erectile dysfunction

ED is often related to problems with blood flow. Maintaining your blood vessel health may be beneficial in both preventing and treating ED. You can achieve this by making certain lifestyle choices, such as eating a healthy diet.

A small2021 studyindicates that aplant-baseddiet can help treat ED.Find out what other foods you may want to add to your grocery cart.

### Natural treatments for erectile dysfunction

For some people, natural remedies may help treat ED.

Certainherbsandsupplementshavebeen studiedto treat ED, with varying degrees of success, including:

* shatavari

* dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

* ginseng, such asKorean red ginseng

* L-arginine

* L-carnitine

* yohimbe

Horny goat weedandzincmay help as well.

### Keep in mind

Don’t buy herbs and supplements for ED treatment unless you speak with your doctor first. Many aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means they might contain additional ingredients not listed on their labels.

Additionally, some supplements, such as yohimbe, are associated with potentially dangerous side effects.

Your doctor may be able to recommend reputable brands as well. Avoid purchasing products online, unless your doctor confirms that they’re safe.Get more expert advice on herbs for ED.

Acupunctureis a type of traditional Chinese medicine in which needles are inserted into the skin at specific locations or acupoints. Acupuncture is believed to work through nerve stimulation, which then affects the release of neurotransmitters.

It’s unclear how acupuncture works to treat ED. Studies on its effectiveness are limited, and those that do exist are often inconclusive.

Findings from a2019 research reviewsuggest that acupuncture may help treat psychological ED, but more studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness.

When choosing an acupuncturist, look for a certified practitioner who uses disposable needles and follows FDA guidelines for needle disposal and sterilization.Learn more about the use of acupuncture in treating ED.

## Erectile dysfunction surgery

In cases where medications aren’t effective, your doctor may recommend surgical treatment. Two types of procedures may be used: implants and vascular surgery.

### Implants

A surgeon can place apenile implant, also referred to as a prosthesis, in the penis.

There are two implant types:

* An inflatable implant allows you to use a pump to make your penis larger.

* A malleable implant allows you to adjust the position of your penis manually.

Penile implants are typically reserved for severe ED that has been unresponsive to traditional ED treatments. Satisfaction and complication rates can vary among participants and could even lead to someone choosing to have the implant removed in some cases.

If you’re considering a penile implant, it’s worth talking with your doctor in detail about what you can expect from the surgery.

### Vascular surgery

Vascular surgery repairs arteries that may be blocked. This type of surgery is rare, and usually only reserved for people with pelvic trauma that leads to vascular injury.

This type of surgery can help to restore adequate blood flow to the penis. Younger people are typically better candidates for this type of procedure.

Every surgery has its benefits and drawbacks. Be sure to discuss these with your doctor if you decide to undergo surgery for ED.

Check out this guide to penile implants, learn how they’re placed, and discover what recovery is like.

### Erectile dysfunction and diabetes

ED and diabetes can occur together. In fact, according to a 2014 review, the risk of developing ED isapproximately 50%in men who have diabetes. But why is this?

Diabetes affects how your body processesglucose. When your body doesn’t store glucose correctly, excess glucose can be found in your blood, leading tohigh blood sugar. There aretwo major types of diabetes:type 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes.

Having high amounts of sugar in your blood can lead to damage to the blood vessels and nerves. This damage can also affect the blood vessels and nerves located around the penis, leading to difficulties getting or maintaining an erection.

## Ways to prevent erectile dysfunction

You can take several steps to help prevent ED. Many of these steps involve making healthy lifestyle changes. Therefore, they’re not only good for preventing ED, but also for improving your overall health.

Follow the advice below to help prevent ED:

* Manage medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.

## When to talk with a doctor

If you are experiencing ED, it can be difficult to talk about it openly with your partner. However, ED is actually more common than you might think. Consider talking with your doctor so they can more accurately diagnose your symptoms.

It’s not uncommon to lose an erection from time to time, especially during periods of increased stress or sudden changes to your diet or lifestyle. But if you’re unable to have or keep an erection frequently over a few weeks, it’s worth contacting your doctor.

In some cases, your symptoms may not actually be stemming from ED but could be symptoms of another medical condition. Your doctor can run a series of tests and evaluations to screen for those medical conditions and ultimately rule them out as potential causes.

The symptoms of ED can be very frustrating and even embarrassing at times, but many resources are available that can help. If you are concerned that you may be experiencing ED, reach out to your doctor to frankly and honestly discuss your options.

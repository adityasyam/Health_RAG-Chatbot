# What Causes Dizziness and How to Treat It

Possible causes of dizziness include vertigo, dehydration, hypoglycemia, and neurological conditions. Lifestyle changes and medications are among the most common treatments.

## What is dizziness?

Dizziness is the feeling of being lightheaded, woozy, or off-balance. It’s linked to the sensory organs, specifically the eyes and ears, so it can sometimes cause fainting. Dizziness isn’t a disease itself but rather a symptom of various disorders.

Dizziness is common. Occasional dizziness isn’t something to worry about. However, it’s important to call a doctor immediately if you’re experiencing repeated episodes of dizziness for no apparent reason or for a prolonged period.

## Dizziness causes

Dizziness has a variety of possible causes.

### Vertigo and disequilibrium

True dizziness is the feeling oflightheadednessor nearlyfainting.

Vertigoand disequilibrium may both cause a feeling of dizziness, but these two terms describe distinct sensations.

Vertigo is characterized by a spinning sensation, like the room is moving. It may also feel likemotion sicknessor as if you’re leaning to one side.

Disequilibrium is a loss ofbalanceor equilibrium.

A common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness isbenign positional vertigo (BPV). BPV leads to short-term dizziness when someone changes positions quickly, such as sitting up in bed after lying down.

Dizziness and vertigo can also be triggered byMeniere’s disease. This condition causes fluid to build up in the ear with associatedear fullness,hearing loss, andtinnitus.

Another possible cause of dizziness and vertigo is anacoustic neuroma. This noncancerous tumor forms on thevestibulocochlear nerve (auditory nerve), which connects the inner ear to the brain.

### Common causes

Losing too much fluid can result indehydration, one of the most common causes of dizziness. Symptoms of dehydration include thirst and dry skin.

Other common causes of dizziness include amigraine attackoralcohol.

Dizziness can also result from a problem in theinner ear, which is the area that senses movement and regulates balance. These problems include hearing loss.

Dizziness may be linked to certain medications, too, including:

* muscle relaxants

* antiepileptic drugs

* antihistamines

* blood pressure medications

### Other possible causes

Some other potential causes of dizziness include:

* Sudden drop in blood pressure:Suddenlow blood pressuremay be caused by various medical conditions or even from standing up (orthostatic hypotension). It can lead to dizziness and falling, especially in older adults.

* Cardiomyopathy:Inthis condition, the heart muscles become rigid and weak and pump less blood. Symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, andtrouble breathing.

* Heart attack:While chest pain is the most common indicator of aheart attack, dizziness or lightheadedness can also besymptoms. They occur if there’s not enough blood reaching your brain.

* Arrhythmia:Arrhythmiaoccurs when the heart beats at an atypical pace. It can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath.

* Circulation problems:Cardiomyopathy, heart attack, and other heart conditions can result incirculation problems, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood. This can cause you to feel dizzy.

* Excessive exercise:Overexerting yourselfmay make you feel dizzy or lightheaded. It can also lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, which can both cause dizziness.

* Heat exhaustion:If you’re in a hot environment and sweating excessively, you’re likely experiencingheat exhaustion. The condition may make you feel dizzy, thirsty, and weak.

* Decrease in blood volume:Low blood volume can result from bleeding or dehydration. It can cause dizziness,fatigue, and low blood pressure. Learn more about the relationship betweendehydration and blood pressure.

* Anxiety disorders:Dizziness may berelated to anxietywith no other physical causes. You may have repeated episodes of dizziness.

* Anemia:Anemiais a low red blood cell count. Low levels of iron-rich hemoglobin in your red blood cells mean the cells can’t transport enough oxygen throughout the body. The lack of oxygen caused by anemia may make you feel dizzy, tired, or short of breath.

* Hypoglycemia:Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can make you feel shaky, lightheaded, or hungry. Severe hypoglycemia is a serious condition that can cause a seizure. Discover othersymptoms associated with hypoglycemia.

* Carbon monoxide poisoning:Ifcarbon monoxide fumesfrom cars, grills, or furnaces build up indoors, breathing them in can be fatal. Dizziness,headache, andvomitingare all symptoms.

* Motion sickness:Traveling by car or boat or experiencing other types of motion can give you motion sickness. You may feel dizzy andnauseous.

* Multiple sclerosis (MS):Multiple sclerosis (MS)damages the brain and spinal cord. It causes a range ofsymptomsthat can include dizziness.

* Parkinson’s disease:Dizziness is a common symptom ofParkinson’s disease, a neurological condition that causes shaking and balance issues. Dizziness may become more noticeable in laterstages of Parkinson’s.

* Infections:A variety of infections are associated with dizziness. Examples include:COVID-19:You may feel dizziness and vertigo while youhave or recover from COVID-19. The dizziness and vertigo may be associated withheadachesand a loss of balance.Other viral infections:Other viral infections, such as thefluor acold, may also cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. These infections may be associated with dehydration as well.Ear infection:Anear infectionmay lead to inflammation in your inner ear, causing dizziness and balance troubles. Ear infections are associated with both bacterial and viral causes.Labyrinthitis andvestibular neuritis:Labyrinthitisandvestibular neuritisoccur when specific nerves in your inner ear become inflamed. Triggers often include viral infections, but they can vary. Bacterial infections are more common in people with labyrinthitis than in people with vestibular neuritis.

* COVID-19:You may feel dizziness and vertigo while youhave or recover from COVID-19. The dizziness and vertigo may be associated withheadachesand a loss of balance.

## Diagnosing the causes of dizziness

A doctor can narrow down the cause of your dizziness by performing aphysical examination. They’ll ask you questions about your dizziness, including:

* when it occurs

* the situations where it occurs

* how severe your symptoms are

* which other symptoms occur with the dizziness

A doctor may also:

* check youreyesandears

* perform a neurological exam

* observe yourposture

If the doctor suspects certain causes, including carbon monoxide poisoning, heart conditions, or a stroke, they may recommend aCT scan, anMRI, or another imaging test. You may also need additional tests.

In some cases, a doctor can’t determine the cause of dizziness.

### Balance tests

A doctor or specialist may perform tests to check your balance. These tests look for problems with your inner ear that may affect your balance or cause dizziness.

They include:

* computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) test, where you try to maintain your balance while standing on a moving platform

* Romberg test, which measures how well you keep your balance when standing with your eyes closed for 1 minute

* electronystagmography (ENG) test, which involves a doctor placing sensors around your eyes and measuring your eye movements

* videonystagmography (VNG) test, in which you’ll wear goggles and view light patterns so a doctor can measure your eye movements

* rotary test, where goggles record your eye movements while you sit in a rotating, motorized chair

### Tests for vertigo

If you have vertigo, the doctor may perform the following tests:

* Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which involves turning your head and then switching quickly between lying down and sitting up so a doctor can check if you experience vertigo

* vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) test, in which a doctor looks for problems in your inner ear by playing sounds into earphones while you move your head and eyes

* video head impulse test, which records your eye movements as you try to keep your eyes on a target while moving your head

### Hearing tests

Hearing tests may also be performed for dizziness and balance issues. These tests may include:

* otoacoustic emissions test, in which a small earphone plays sounds in your ear and a doctor measures the echoes that come back from your inner ear

* tympanometry, in which a doctor blows air into your ear to evaluate the movement of your eardrum

* electrocochleography, which tests the electrical activity of the cochlea (a hollow bone in theinner ear) using an electrode placed in the ear

Electrocochleography can help diagnose Meniere’s disease.

### Cardiac tests

Tests that can help a doctor diagnose cardiac causes of dizziness include the:

* electrocardiogram (EKG), which they use to measure your heart’s electrical activity

* echocardiogram, which is a type of ultrasound that reveals how well your heart works

* stress test, where a doctor monitors your heart as you use a treadmill or perform another type of exercise

## Tips for managing dizziness

Follow these tips if you have recurrent bouts of dizziness:

* Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy and rest until the dizziness goes away. This can prevent you from possibly losing your balance, which may lead to falling and serious injury.

* Use a cane or walker for stability, if necessary.

* Always use handrails when walking up or down stairs.

* Try activities that can help improve your balance, such asyogaandtai chi.

* Avoid moving or switching positions suddenly.

* Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you frequently experience dizziness without warning.

* Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Using these substances may trigger dizziness or make it worse.

* Drink plenty of waterandget sufficient sleep. Avoiding stressful situations may also be helpful.

* If you suspect a medication is causing your dizziness, talk with your doctor about lowering the dose or switching to another medication.

* Take an OTC medication such asmeclizine(Antivert, Bonine) if you experience nausea along with dizziness. These medications may cause drowsiness, so do not use them when you need to be active or productive.

* Rest in a cool place and drink water if your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration.

Always speak with a doctor if you’re concerned about the frequency or severity of your dizziness.

## Takeaway

Most cases of dizziness clear up on their own once you treat the underlying cause. In rare cases, dizziness can be a symptom of a more serious health problem.

Dizziness may result in complications related to fainting or a loss of balance. This can be especially dangerous when you’re driving, operating heavy machinery, or climbing a ladder.

Use caution if you feel an episode of dizziness coming on. If you become dizzy, stop driving immediately or find a safe place to steady yourself until the feeling passes.

# Everything You Need to Know About Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it makes.

The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes.

Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health.

## Types of diabetes

There are a few different types of diabetes:

* Type 1:Type 1 diabetesis anautoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in thepancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack.

* Type 2:Type 2 diabetesoccurs when your body becomes resistant toinsulin, and sugar builds up in your blood. It’s the most common type—about90% to 95%of people living with diabetes have type 2.

* Type 1.5:Type 1.5 diabetesis also known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). It occurs during adulthood and sets in gradually like type 2 diabetes. LADA is an autoimmune disease that cannot be treated by diet or lifestyle.

* Gestational:Gestational diabetesis high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes.

A rare condition calleddiabetes insipidusis not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body.

Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments.

Learn more abouthow these types differfrom one another.

## Prediabetes

Prediabetesis the term that’s used when your blood sugar is higher than expected, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when the cells in your body don’t respond to insulin the way they should. This can lead to type 2 diabetes down the road.

Experts suggest that more than1 in 3 Americanshave prediabetes, butover 80%of people with prediabetes don’t even know it.

## Symptoms of diabetes

Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.

### General symptoms

The symptoms of type 1, type 2, and type 1.5 (LADA) are the same, but they occur in a shorter period than types 2 and 1.5. In type 2, the onset tends to be slower. Tingling nerves and slow-healing sores are more common in type 2.

Left untreated, type 1, in particular, can lead todiabetic ketoacidosis. This is when there is a dangerous level of ketones in the body. It’s less common in other types of diabetes, but still possible.

The general symptoms of diabetes include:

* increased hunger

* increased thirst

* weight loss

* frequent urination

* blurry vision

* extreme fatigue

* sores that don’t heal

### Symptoms in men

In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes,men with diabetesmay have:

* adecreased sex drive

* erectile dysfunction

* poor muscle strength

### Symptoms in women

Women with diabetescan have symptoms such as:

* vaginal dryness

* urinary tract infections

* yeast infections

* dry, itchy skin

### Gestational diabetes

Most people who develop gestational diabetes don’t have any symptoms. Healthcare professionals often detect the condition during a routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test, which is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.

In rare cases, a person with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.

### The bottom line

Diabetes symptoms can be so mild that they’re hard to spot at first. Learnwhich signsshould prompt a trip to the doctor.

## Discover more about Type 2 Diabetes

## Causes of diabetes

Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes

Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in thepancreas.

Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.

### Type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination ofgeneticsand lifestyle factors. Having overweight orobesityincreases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especiallyin your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.

This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.

### Type 1.5 diabetes

Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed.

### Gestational diabetes

Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.

People who areoverweight when they get pregnantor whogain too much weight during pregnancyare more likely to get gestational diabetes.

### The bottom line

Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes.

Get more information on the causes of diabetes.

## Diabetes risk factors

Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.

### Type 1 diabetes

You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you havea parent or siblingwith the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.

### Type 2 diabetes

Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:

* are overweight

* are age 45 or older

* have a parent or sibling with the condition

* aren’t physically active

* have had gestational diabetes

* have prediabetes

* havehigh blood pressure,high cholesterol, orhigh triglycerides

Type 2 diabetes also disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic populations.

Adults who have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, or Asian American ancestry are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than white adults, according to2016 research. They’re also more likely to experience decreased quality of care and increased barriers to self-management.

### Type 1.5 diabetes

Type 1.5 diabetes is found in adults over 30 and is often mistaken for type 2, but people with this condition are not necessarily overweight, and oral medications and lifestyle changes have no effect.

### Gestational diabetes

Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you:

* are overweight

* are over age 25

* had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy

* have given birth to a baby weighingmore than 9 pounds

* have a family history of type 2 diabetes

* havepolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

### The bottom line

Your family history, environment, and preexisting medical conditions can all affect your odds of developing diabetes.

Find out which risks you can control and which ones you can’t.

## Diabetes complications

High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications.

Complications associated with diabetes include:

* heart disease,heart attack, andstroke

* neuropathy

* nephropathy

* retinopathyandvision loss

* hearing loss

* foot damage, such as infections and sores that don’t heal

* skin conditions, such asbacterialandfungalinfections

* depression

* dementia

### Gestational diabetes

Unmanaged gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Complications affecting the baby can include:

* premature birth

* higher-than-typical weight at birth

* increased risk for type 2 diabetes later in life

* low blood sugar

* jaundice

* stillbirth

A pregnant person with gestational diabetes can develop complications such as high blood pressure (preeclampsia) or type 2 diabetes. You may also requirecesarean delivery, commonly referred to as a C-section.

The risk of gestational diabetes in future pregnancies also increases.

### The bottom line

Diabetes can lead to serious medical complications, but you can manage the condition with medications and lifestyle changes.

Avoid the most common diabetes complications with these helpful tips.

## Treatment of diabetes

Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.

### Type 1 and 1.5 diabetes

Insulinis the main treatment for type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce.

Various types of insulin are commonly used by people with type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. They differ in how quickly they start to work and how long their effects last:

* Rapid-acting insulin:starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 2 to 4 hours

* Short-acting insulin:starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 3 to 6 hours

* Intermediate-acting insulin:starts to work within 2 to 4 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours

* Long-acting insulin:starts to work 2 hours after injection and lasts up to 24 hours

* Ultra-long acting insulin:starts to work 6 hours after injection and lasts 36 hours or more

* Premixed insulin:starts working within 15 to 30 minutes (depending on whether a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is part of the mix) and lasts 10 to 16 hours

### Type 2 diabetes

Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood sugar, you’ll need to take medication.

These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways:

You may need to take more than one of these medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin.

### Gestational diabetes

If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, you’ll need tomonitor your blood sugar levelseveral times per day during pregnancy. If it’s high, dietary changes and exercise may be enough to bring it down.

Research has found that about15% to 30%of women who develop gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the developing baby.

### The bottom line

The treatment regimen your doctor recommends will depend on the type of diabetes you have and its cause.

Check outthis list of the various medicationsthat are available to treat diabetes.

## Diabetes and diet

Healthy eating is a central part of managing diabetes. In some cases, changing your diet may be enough to manage the disease.

### Types 1 and 1.5 diabetes

Your blood sugar level rises or falls based on the types of foods you eat. Starchy or sugary foods make blood sugar levels rise rapidly. Protein and fat cause more gradual increases.

Your medical team may recommend that you limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. You’ll also need to balance your carb intake with your insulin doses. Counting carbs helps to balance the carb intake with the insulin doses.

Check out this guide to starting a type 1 diabetes diet.

### Type 2 diabetes

Eating the right types of foods can both manage your blood sugar and help you lose any excess weight.

Carb counting is an important part of eating for type 2 diabetes. A dietitian can help you figure out how many grams of carbohydrates to eat at each meal.

In order to keep your blood sugar levels steady, try to eat small meals throughout the day. Emphasize healthy foods such as:

* fruits

* vegetables

* whole grains

* lean protein such as poultry andfish

* healthy fatssuch asolive oilandnuts

Certain other foods can hurt efforts to manage your blood sugar.

Discover the foods you should avoid if you have diabetes.

### Gestational diabetes

Eating a well-balanced diet is important for both you and your baby during these 9 months. Making the right food choices can also help you avoid diabetes medications.

Watch your portion sizes, and limit sugary or salty foods. Although you need some sugar to feed your growing baby, you should avoid eating too much. Check outother do’s and don’tsfor healthy eating with gestational diabetes.

### The bottom line

Work with a registered dietitian if you have access to one. They can help you design an individualized diabetes meal plan. Getting the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs can help you manage your blood sugar.

## Diabetes and exercise

Along with diet and treatment, exercise plays an essential role in diabetes management. This is true for all types of diabetes.

Staying active helps your cells react to insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. Exercising regularly can also help you:

* reach and maintain a healthy weight

* reduce your risk of diabetes-related health complications

* boost mood

* get better sleep

* improve memory

If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, general guidance is to aim for at least150 minutesof moderate-intensity exercise each week. There are currently no separate exercise guidelines for people who have gestational diabetes. But if you’re pregnant, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity level over time to avoid overdoing it.

Diabetes-friendly exercisesinclude:

* walking

* swimming

* dancing

* cycling

Talk with your doctor about safe ways to incorporate activity into your diabetes management plan. You may need to follow special precautions, like checking your blood sugar before and after working out and making sure to stay hydrated.

Consider working with a personal trainer or exercise physiologist who has experience working with people who have diabetes. They can help you develop a personalized workout plan tailored to your needs.

## Diabetes diagnosis

Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the condition should be tested. People are routinely tested for gestational diabetes during theirsecond trimesterorthird trimesterof pregnancy.

Doctors use theseblood teststo diagnose prediabetes and diabetes:

* The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood sugar after you’ve fasted for 8 hours.

* TheA1C testprovides a snapshot of your blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months.

* A 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test is also used. This checks the BG 2 hours after ingesting a sugary drink containing 75 grams of carbs.

### How to diagnose gestational diabetes

Todiagnose gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels between the24th weekand28th weekof pregnancy. There are two types of tests:

* Glucose challenge test:During a glucose challenge test, your blood sugar is checked an hour after you drink a sugary liquid. If your results are standard, no more testing is done. If blood sugar levels are high, you’ll need to undergo a glucose tolerance test.

* Glucose tolerance test:During a glucose tolerance test, your blood sugar is checked after you fast overnight. Then you’re given a sugary drink and your blood sugar is re-tested after 1 hour and again after 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if any of these three readings come back noting high blood sugar.

The earlier you are diagnosed with diabetes, the sooner you can start treatment. Find out whether you should get tested, and getmore information on testsyour doctor might perform.

If you don’t already have a primary care specialist, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool.

## Diabetes prevention

Type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are not preventable because they are caused by an issue with the immune system. Some causes of type 2 diabetes, such as your genes or age, aren’t under your control either.

Yet many other diabetes risk factors are manageable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your diet and fitness routine.

If you’ve received a diagnosis of prediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes:

* Get at least 150 minutes per week ofaerobic exerciseslike walking orcycling.

* Cutsaturatedandtransfats, along withrefined carbohydrates, out of your diet.

* Eat morefruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

* Eat smaller portions.

* Try to lose5% to 7%of your body weight if you have overweight or obesity.

These aren’t the only ways to prevent diabetes. Discovermore strategies that may helpyou avoid this chronic health condition.

## Diabetes in pregnancy

People who’ve never had diabetes can suddenly develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Hormones produced by the placenta can make your body moreresistant to the effects of insulin.

### Pre-gestational diabetes

People can have diabetes before they conceive and carry it with them into pregnancy. This is calledpre-gestational diabetes.

### Risks to your newborn

Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to complications for your newborn, such as jaundice orbreathing problems.

If you’re diagnosed with pre-gestational or gestational diabetes, you’ll need special monitoring to prevent complications.

### Does gestational diabetes disappear on its own?

Gestational diabetes should go away after you deliver, but it does significantly increase your risk of getting diabetes later.About halfof people with gestational diabetes will go on to develop type 2 diabetes.

## Diabetes in children

Children can get both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Managing blood sugar is especially important in young people because diabetes can damage important organs such as the heart and kidneys.

### Type 1 diabetes

The autoimmune form of diabetes often starts in childhood. One of the main symptoms isincreased urination. Kids with type 1 diabetes may start wetting the bed after they’ve been toilet trained.

Extreme thirst, fatigue, and hunger are also signs of the condition. It’s important that children with type 1 diabetes get treatment right away. The condition can cause high blood sugar,dehydration, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can bemedical emergencies.

### Type 2 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because type 2 was so rare in children. Now that more children have overweight orobesity, type 2 diabetes isbecoming more commonin this age group.

Some children living with type 2 diabetes don’t experience symptoms. Others may experience:

* increased thirst

* frequent urination

* extreme fatigue

* blurry vision

Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed based on medical history, a physical exam, and bloodwork.

Untreated type 2 diabetes can cause lifelong complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness. Healthy eating and exercise can help your child manage their blood sugar and prevent these problems.

Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent than ever in young people. Learnhow to spot the signsso you can report them to your child’s doctor.

## Takeaway

Some types of diabetes — like types 1 and 1.5 — are caused by factors that are out of your control. Others — like type 2 — can be prevented by making better food choices, increasing activity, and losing weight.

Discuss potential diabetes risks with your doctor. If you’re at risk, have your blood sugar tested and follow your doctor’s advice for managing your blood sugar.

# Understanding Crohn’s Disease

Crohn’s disease affects your GI tract, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and bloody stool. Dietary changes and medications can help you manage some symptoms. However, most people will eventually need surgery.

Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As many as780,000 Americanshave the condition, according to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA).

More research onCrohn’s diseaseis necessary. Researchers aren’t sure how it begins, who is most likely to develop it, or how to best manage it. Despite major treatment advances in the last three decades, no cure is available yet.

Crohn’s disease most commonly occurs in the small intestine and the colon. It can affect any part of yourgastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth to the anus. It can involve some parts of the GI tract and skip other parts.

The range of severity for Crohn’s is mild to debilitating. Symptoms vary and can change over time. In severe cases, the disease can lead to life threatening flares and complications.

Here’s everything you need to know about Crohn’s disease.

## Crohn’s disease symptoms

The symptoms of Crohn’s disease often develop gradually. Certain symptoms may also become worse over time. Although it’s possible, it’srarefor symptoms to develop suddenly and dramatically.

The earliest symptoms of Crohn’s disease can include:

* diarrhea

* abdominal cramps

* blood in your stool

* fever

* fatigue

* loss of appetite

* unexplained weight loss

* feeling as if your bowels aren’t empty after a bowel movement

* feeling afrequent need for bowel movements

It’s sometimes possible to mistake these symptoms for those of another condition, such asfood poisoning, anupset stomach, or an allergy. You should see your doctor if any of these symptoms persist.

The symptoms may become more severe as the disease progresses. More serious symptoms may include:

* aperianal fistula, which causes pain and drainage near your anus

* ulcers that may occur anywhere from the mouth to the anus

* inflammation of the joints and skin

* shortness of breath or decreased ability to exercise due to anemia

Early detection and diagnosis can help you avoid severe complications and allow you to begin treatment early.

## What are the variations of Crohn’s disease?

There are five variations of Crohn’s disease, all based on location in the digestive system. They are:

* Gastroduodenal Crohn’s disease:This typeaffects the stomach and the duodenum, which is the first part of your small intestine.

* Jejunoileitis:This type affects the second portion of your intestine, called the jejunum.

* Ileitis:This type affects the ileum, which is the last part of the small intestine.

* Ileocolitis:This type affects the ileum and the colon.

* Crohn’s colitis:This type affects the colon only.

In addition, Crohn’s disease can present asperianal disease, which involves fistulas (abnormal connections between tissues), deep tissue infections, as well as sores and ulcers on the outer skin around the anus.

## What causes Crohn’s disease?

It isn’t clear what causes Crohn’s disease.

One possibility is that it’s a type ofautoimmune condition. This is a type of condition in whichyour immune system mistakenly attacksyour body, sometimes causing inflammation.

Though the immune system could be a potential contributor to inflammation in Crohn’s, it has not yet been classified asan autoimmune conditionas the causes are still not fully understood.

### Risk factors

The following factors may influence your chances of developing it:

* inheriting certain genes

* having relativeswith the disease, and in particular,having a twinwith the disease

* smoking

* using medications likeoral contraceptives, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

* living in an urban environment

## Crohn’s disease diagnosis

Crohn’s is typically diagnosedbased on the results of tissue samples taken from your digestive tract during an upper or lowerendoscopy.

Othertestsmay also point to Crohn’s disease, and their results — combined with your symptoms and history — will be taken into consideration. These testsincludeblood andstool tests, as well as anendoscopyandcolonoscopy, during which your doctor will likely do abiopsy. You may also need imaging tests likeCTandMRI.

Once the doctor reviews the results of all the tests and gets a clear picture of your symptoms, they may conclude you have Crohn’s disease.

Your doctor may go on to request these tests several more times to look for affected tissue and determine how the disease is progressing.

## Treatment for Crohn’s disease

A cure for Crohn’s disease isn’t available yet, but the disease can be managed. A variety of treatment options exist that can lessen the severity and frequency of your symptoms.

### Medications

Several types of medications are available to treat Crohn’s. These include:

* antidiarrheals

* anti-inflammatory drugs

* biologics

* immunomodulators

Antibioticsmay help reduce some of the symptoms of Crohn’s and some of the possible triggers for it. For example, antibioticscan reducedrainage and healfistulas, which are abnormal connections between tissues that Crohn’s can cause.

### Surgery

If less invasive treatments and lifestyle changes don’t improve your symptoms,surgerymay be necessary. Ultimately,about 80%of people with Crohn’s disease will require surgery at some point in their lives, according to the CCFA.

Types of surgeries include:

* strictureplasty

* bowel resection

* ostomy

* colectomy

* proctocolectomy

Crohn’s disease surgery is helpful for relieving symptoms, but it’s not without risk. Talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have with surgery.

### Diet

Food doesn’t cause Crohn’s disease, but it can trigger flares. A diet plan that works for one person with Crohn’s disease may not work for another. This is because the disease can involve different areas of the GI tract in different people.

It’s important to find out what works best for you. This can be done by keeping track of your symptoms as you add or remove certain foods from your diet and in consultation with your doctor or a registered dietitian.

Lifestyle and diet changes that may help you include:

* Reduce fiber:For some people, foods with fiber may aggravate the GI tract. If this is true for you, you may need to switch to alow residue diet.Researchon this particular diet has been mixed, so speak with your doctor about your personal needs.

* Limit fat:Crohn’s disease may interfere with your body’s ability to break down and absorb fat. However, a2017 studyon mice suggested that a diet higher in plant-based fats may positively affect thegut microbiomein people with Crohn’s disease. More research is needed, and your doctor or a registered dietitian can help guide you in your fat intake.

* Limit dairy:Even if you’re notlactose intolerant, your bodycan develop difficultydigesting some dairy products when you have Crohn’s disease. Consuming dairy can lead to an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea for some people.

* Drink water:Crohn’s disease may affect your body’s ability to absorb water from your digestive tract. This can lead todehydration. The risk ofdehydrationis especially high if you’re having diarrhea or bleeding.

* Take vitamin and mineral supplements:Crohn’s disease can affect your intestines’ ability to properly absorb other nutrients from your food. Eatingnutrient-dense foodsmay not be enough. Talk with your doctor about takingmultivitaminsto find out if this is right for you.

### Natural treatments

Some people usecomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)to help manage symptoms of various conditions and diseases, including Crohn’s disease.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t approved these for treatment, but some people use them in addition to mainstream medications.

Don’t add any new treatments to your current treatment plan without consulting your doctor.

Some CAM treatments for Crohn’s disease include:

* Probiotics:Thesemay help prevent microorganisms from upsetting your gut’s natural balance and causing a Crohn’s flare. Scientific data about effectiveness is limited.

* Prebiotics: These arepotentially beneficial materialsfound in plants that help feed the good bacteria in your gut and increase their numbers.

* Fish oil:Oily fish like salmon and mackerel are rich inomega-3s.Researchis ongoing regarding the use offish oilin the treatment of Crohn’s disease.

* Supplements:Some herbs, vitamins, and minerals may help ease the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.Researchis ongoing as to which supplements may be beneficial.

* Acupuncture:Researchhas found thatacupuncture, combined withmoxibustion— a type of traditional Chinese medicine that involves burning dried medicinal herbs on or near your skin — may help improve some symptoms.

Tell your doctor if you use any CAM treatments or over-the-counter medications. Some of these substances can affect the efficiency of medications or other treatments. In some cases, an interaction or side effect could be dangerous or even life threatening.

## Frequently asked questions

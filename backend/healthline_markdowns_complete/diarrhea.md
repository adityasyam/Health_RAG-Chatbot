Diarrhea can be acute or chronic.

Acute diarrhea occurs when the condition lasts for 1 to 2 days. You might experience diarrhea due to a viral or bacterial infection you acquired via something you ate or drank.

Chronic diarrhearefers to having diarrhea on most days for longer than 3 to 4 weeks. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea include:

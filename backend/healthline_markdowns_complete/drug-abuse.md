# What You Need to Know About Substance Use Disorder

Overview

Substance use disorder is a health condition involving compulsive substance use. It develops when substance use interferes with the ability to function day to day. It can occur with prescription or nonprescription drugs.

Medical professionals previously used the term “drug abuse” to describe substance use disorder. Another term for substance use disorder is addiction. This differs fromdependence.

Substance misuse greatly affects public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than70,000 peoplein the United States died fromoverdosesin 2017. And every year, around88,000 peopledie fromexcessive alcohol usein the United States.

Substance misuse also leads to other public health problems, such as:

* drunk and impaired driving

* violence

* familial stress

* potential forchild abuse and neglect

Sharing or reusing needles for intravenous drug use also increases the risk of contracting and transmittinginfectious diseases, includingHIVandhepatitis.

TheAmerican Psychiatric Association (APA)describessubstance use disorderas a brain disease. It’s characterized by repeated substance use despite negative effects. Substance use disorder involves many social and biological factors.

The most successful way to prevent substance use disorder is through education.

## Risk factors

Substance misuse and addiction can affect anyone. However, there are some things that may increase the chance of developing a substance use disorder.

As is the case with many conditions, genetics play a key role in addiction. Research indicates that genetic factors may be responsible for40 to 60 percentof an individual’s susceptibility to developing a substance use disorder.

Other risk factors for developing substance misuse issues include:

* physical,sexual, oremotionalabuse

* exposure totrauma

* family members or peers who use or misuse substances

* access to these substances

* mental health disorders, such as:depressionanxietyeating disorderspersonality disorderssubstance use at an early age

* depression

* anxiety

* eating disorders

* personality disorders

* substance use at an early age

### Adolescent substance misuse

Adolescents are likely to experiment with substances. Their brains aren’t fully developed, so they don’t have the same decision making abilities as adults. As such, they may develop substance misuse issues.

Risk factors for adolescent substance misuse include:

* parents or family members who misuse substances

* childhood mistreatment, such asabuseorneglect

* peer pressure to use substances

* bullying

* gang affiliation

* certain conditions, likeADHDordepression

Having one or more of these risk factors doesn’t mean someone will develop an addiction. However, the more risk factors present, the greater the likelihood substance use will progress to misuse or addiction.

## Depressants

Substances classified as depressants (or central nervous system depressants) reduce activity in yourcentral nervous system (CNS). They make you feel relaxed anddrowsy.

However, depressants’ effects vary depending on the amount consumed and an individual’s specific reaction to the substance.

For example, low doses of depressants can actually have a stimulant effect and cause a euphoric feeling. Larger doses cause depressant effects, such as cognitive impairment orloss of coordination.

### Alcohol

Your body rapidly absorbsalcoholfrom your stomach and small intestine into your bloodstream. Alcoholimpairsbrain function and motor skills. It can affect every organ in your body. Alcohol can alsoharm a developing fetusin those who are pregnant.

Alcohol in moderation may be part of a healthy diet. Onestandard drinkequals:

* 12 ounces of beer

* 8 to 9 ounces of malt liquor

* 5 ounces of wine

* 1.5 ounces of liquor

But heavy alcohol use increases the risk of:

* liver disease

* stroke

* cancer

Alcohol use disorderoccurs when your use of alcohol affects your daily life, like your ability to work or maintain relationships. Heavy alcohol misuse can harm your health in the long term.

Alcohol is the most commonly used recreational substance in the United States. The2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)found that, over a 30-day period, approximately 139.8 million Americans 12 years old and older (51.1 percent) used alcohol at least once, and 16.6 million Americans reported heavy alcohol use.

### Heroin

Heroin is anopioid. Like the prescription drugmorphine, heroin is made from the seed of the poppy plant, or opium. Heroin is also referred to as:

* smack

* H

* ska

* junk

It’s typically injected into a vein, smoked, or snorted. It can also be administered rectally. Heroin produces a euphoric feeling and clouded thinking, followed bya drowsy state.

Heroin use can lead to:

* heart problems

* miscarriages

* overdose

* death

Regular heroin use leads to increased tolerance. This means that over time, you may need to take more of the substance to experience its desired effects. If abruptly stopped,withdrawal symptomstypically occur. Because of this, many people who use heroin continue to use it to avoid feeling sick.

## Stimulants

Stimulants increase CNS activity. They can temporarily make someone feel more alert, energized, or confident.

Misuse can lead to serious risks, such as:

* insomnia

* cardiovascular issues

* seizures

### Cocaine

* blood pressure

* heart rate

Heavy and prolonged cocaine use can lead to:

* heart attacks

* chalk

* meth

* ice

* crystal

* glad

## ‘Club’ drugs

This category refers to a wide variety of substances people often use at dance parties, clubs, and bars.

They include the following:

* Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB).It’s also known as grievous bodily harm, G, and liquid ecstasy.

They can cause:

* serious short-term mental health problems, such asdelirium

* physical health issues, such asrapid heart rate,seizures, anddehydration

* death

Risks of these side effects increase when they’remixed with alcohol.

## Other compounds

There are other commonly misused substances that don’t fall into the above categories.

Anabolic steroidsare also commonly known as:

* juice

* gym candy

* pumpers

* stackers

Steroids are lab-made substances. They mimictestosterone, the male sex hormone, and are taken orally or injected.

Using inhalants comes with risks. They can lead to:

* a loss of sensation

* a loss of consciousness

* a loss of hearing

* spasms

* brain damage

* heart failure

The 2018 NSDUH found that about2 millionpeople ages 12 and older used inhalants in the past year. That represents 0.7 percent of Americans in this age group.

## Prescription drugs

Many people are prescribed medication to manage pain and other conditions. Prescription drug misuse occurs when you take a medication that’s not prescribed to you, or you take it for reasons other than those prescribed by your doctor.

Some people who take these medications can develop a substance use disorder, even when they’re using the medication exactly as prescribed.

These drugsmay include:

* opioidsfor pain management, such asfentanyl(Duragesic, Subsys),oxycodone(OxyContin, Xtampza ER), or acetaminophen/hydrocodone

* anxietyorsleepmedicine, such asalprazolam(Xanax) ordiazepam(Valium)

* stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) oramphetamine/dextroamphetamine(Adderall)

Their effects differ depending on the medication, but misusing prescription drugs can lead to:

* drowsiness

* depressed breathing

* slowed brain function

* anxiety

* paranoia

* seizures

The misuse of prescription drugs hasincreasedover the past few decades. This is partially because they’ve become more widely available.

## Stages of substance use disorder

Some experts break up substance use disorder into the following stages:

* In the experimental use stage, you use the substance with peers for recreation.

* In the regular use stage, you change your behavior and use the substance to fix negative feelings.

* In the daily preoccupation, or risky use, stage, you’re preoccupied with the substance and don’t care about your life outside of your substance use.

* In the dependence stage, you’re unable to face your life without using the substance. Your financial and personal problems increase. You may also take risks to obtain the substance that result in legal problems.

## Treating substance use disorder

Medical treatment is available for substance use disorders. Programs should follow these principles of addiction treatment:

* Addictionis a complex but treatable health condition.

* There’s no single treatment that works for everyone.

* Treatment is readily available.

* Treatment focuses on your multiple needs.

* Treatment addresses your mental health. Your treatment needs are regularly evaluated to ensure your treatment is meeting them.

* It’s critical to remain in treatment for an adequate amount of time. Voluntary and involuntary treatment can be effective.

* Potential substance use is monitored during treatment becauserelapsescan and do happen.

Treatment programs should also check and assess forinfectious diseaseswhile providing risk-education counseling. This empowers you to take control of your health so you don’t contract or transmit infectious diseases.

### Detoxification

Depending on the type of substance use disorder, the first stage of treatment may be medically assisted detoxification. Duringthis process, supportive care is provided as the substance is cleared from your bloodstream.

Detoxification is followed by other treatments to encourage long-term abstinence. Many treatments involve both individual and group counseling. These are provided in outpatient facilities or inpatient residential recovery programs.

Medications can also reduce withdrawal symptoms and encourage recovery. Inheroin addiction, for example, your doctor may prescribe a medication calledmethadoneor buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone). These medications can ease your recovery and help you cope with the intense withdrawal stage.

## Preventing substance use disorder

The best way to avoid a substance use disorder is to prevent use in the first place. However, while abstaining from substances is the safest approach, it may not be the most realistic. Because of this, education and safety practices are the best tools to reduce harm and avoid addiction.

Mental healthcare, community outreach, and reducing stigma can all help prevent the development of substance use disorders.Harm reduction programscan also reduce complications of substance use and connect people to treatment.

If you’re a parent and concerned about your children’s substance use, create a safe space to talk openly with your children. The more knowledge and trust, the better.

# Everything You Need to Know About Eczema

Eczema is a common skin condition that causes itchy, red, dry, and irritated skin. The type of eczema you have can determine what type of rash you develop and where on your body it occurs.

Eczema is also called atopic dermatitis. It typically startsduring infancy or early childhoodand can persist into adulthood. However, eczema can occur in people of any age.

Photo examples of the different types of eczema are shown below. Keep reading to learn more about eczema, including its causes, how to treat flares, and how to prevent them.

### Examples of eczema rashes

## What causes eczema?

The cause of eczema isn’t completely understood. However, researchers think that it’s triggered by an overactive immune system.

Eczema tends to flare when your skin is exposed to external irritants, which cause your immune system to overreact. We’ve listed common triggers for flare-ups below.

Additionally, researchers have found that some people with eczema don’t make enough of a protein called filaggrin (filament aggregating protein). This protein is responsible for helping your skin stay moisturized and healthy.

### Eczema triggers

Aneczema flare-uphappens when one or more eczema symptoms appear on the skin. According to theNational Health Service (NHS), research has shown that external and internal factors can contribute to flares of eczema. Common triggers include:

* chemicals or preservatives found in cleansers and detergents

* scented products

* cigarette smoke

* external allergens such as pollens, mold, dust, or dust mites

* rough scratchy material, like wool

* synthetic fabrics

* sweating

* temperature changes

* stress

* food allergies

* animal dander

* upper respiratory infections

## What are the types of eczema?

There are a number of different types of eczema, including the following:

## What are the symptoms of eczema?

The main symptom of eczema is itchy, dry, rough, flaky, inflamed, and irritated skin. It can flare up, subside, and then flare up again.

Eczema can occur anywhere but usually affects the arms, inner elbows, backs of the knees, cheeks, and scalp. It’s not contagious and sometimes becomes less severe with age.

Other symptoms include:

* intense itching

* red or brownish-gray patches

* small, raised bumps that ooze fluid when scratched

* crusty patches of dried yellowish ooze, which can signal infection

* thickened, scaly skin

* sore or raw-feeling skin

Many people find their symptoms get worse at night, making it difficult to sleep. Scratching eczema further irritates and inflames the skin. This can cause infections that must be treated with antibiotics.

Sometimes, mild eczema can be managed at home by avoiding triggers and keeping skin moisturized. However, it’s best to see a doctor when symptoms are hard to manage or are getting worse. It’s a good idea to make a medical appointment if your:

* eczema isn’t responding to over-the-counter treatments

* symptoms are keeping you awake at night

* skin is blistering or weeping fluids

* skin is peeling

* skin is getting thick or scaly

## How is eczema treated?

Adermatologist,allergist, or primary care doctor can help you identify the correct treatment for eczema. The right treatment for you will depend on the type and severity of your eczema. You might find it helpful to combine more than one treatment.

Options include:

### Medications

Oral over-the-counter (OTC)antihistaminescan relieve itching. They work by blocking allergic reactions triggered by histamine. However, they can cause drowsiness, so it’s best to take them when you don’t need to be alert.

Examples include:

* cetirizine(Zyrtec)

* diphenhydramine (Benadryl)

* fexofenadine (Allegra)

* loratadine (Claritin)

Cortisone(steroid) creams and ointments can relieve itching and scaling. But they can have side effects after long-term use, including:

* thinning of the skin

* irritation

* discoloration

Low potency steroids, likehydrocortisone, are available OTC and can help treat mild eczema. High potency steroids for moderate orsevere eczemacan be prescribed by a doctor.

To treat an infection, a doctor may prescribe a topical or oral antibiotic.

Immunosuppressantsare prescription medications that prevent your immune system from overreacting. This prevents flare-ups of eczema. Side effects include an increased risk of developing cancer, infection, high blood pressure, and kidney disease.

### Therapies

Light therapy, or phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light or sunlamps to help prevent immune system responses that trigger eczema. It requires a series of treatments and can help reduce or clear up eczema. It can also prevent bacterial skin infections.

### Lifestyle changes

Stress can trigger symptoms or make them worse. Ways to reduce stress include:

* doing deep breathing exercises

* practicing yoga

* meditating

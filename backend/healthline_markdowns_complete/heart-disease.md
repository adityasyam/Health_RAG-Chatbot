# Everything You Need to Know About Heart Disease

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It can’t be cured or reversed, but medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes can relieve many symptoms.

According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 5 deaths resulted from heart disease in 2021 in the United States. That’s about 695,000people.

## Who gets heart disease?

Heart disease doesn’t discriminate. It’s the leading cause of death for several populations, including white people, Hispanic people, and Black people. Almost half of people in the United States are at risk of heart disease, and thenumbers are rising.

While it can be deadly, it’s also preventable in most people. By adopting certain lifestyle habits early, you can potentially live longer with a healthier heart.

## What are the different types of heart disease?

Heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiovascular problems. Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease.

Types of heart disease include:

* arrhythmia

* atherosclerosis

* cardiomyopathy

* congenital heart defects

* coronary artery disease (CAD)

* heart infections

The term “cardiovascular disease” may also refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.

## What are the symptoms of heart disease?

Different types of heart disease can cause a variety of symptoms.

### Arrhythmia

Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm. The symptoms you experience may depend on the type of arrhythmia you have, such as a heart rate that’stoo fastortoo slow.

Learn more about thesymptoms of arrhythmia.

### Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis reduces blood supply to your extremities. In addition tochest painandshortness of breath, symptoms of atherosclerosis include fatigue and muscle weakness in the legs from poor circulation.

Learn more about thesymptoms of atherosclerosis.

### Congenital heart defects

Congenital heart defects are heart problems that develop when a fetus is growing. Some heart defects are never diagnosed. Others may be detected when they cause symptoms.

Learn more about thesymptoms of congenital heart defects.

### Coronary artery disease (CAD)

CAD is plaque buildup in the arteries that move oxygen-rich blood through the heart and lungs.

Learn more about thesymptoms of CAD.

### Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathy is a disease that causes the heart muscles to grow larger and turn rigid, thick, or weak.

Learn more about the symptoms ofcardiomyopathy.

### Heart infections

Heart infections include the conditionsendocarditisandmyocarditis.

## What are the symptoms of heart disease in women?

Females often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than males, specifically CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.

A2016 studylooked at the symptoms most often seen in women who had experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include the “classic” heart attack symptoms, such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, researchers reported that women were more likely to experienceanxiety, indigestion, and fatigue.

Symptoms of heart disease in females can also be confused with other conditions, such asdepression,menopause, and anxiety.

Learn more about thecommon signs and symptoms of heart attack in men and women.

## What causes heart disease?

Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Each type of heart disease is caused by something entirely unique to that condition.

### Arrhythmia causes

Thecauses of an abnormal heart rhythminclude:

* diabetes

* CAD

* heart defects

* high blood pressure(hypertension)

* certain medications

### Congenital heart defect causes

This heart disease occurs while a baby is still developing in the uterus. Some heart defects may be serious and diagnosed and treated early. Some may also go undiagnosed for many years.

Yourheart’s structurecan also change as you age. This can create a heart defect that may lead to complications and problems.

### Cardiomyopathy causes

There are several types of cardiomyopathy. Each type is the result of a separate condition:

* dilated cardiomyopathy(themost commontype)

* hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

* restrictive cardiomyopathy

The causes range from other medical conditions orcomorbiditiesor genetics. Not all the causes are fully understood.

### Heart infection causes

Bacteria, parasites, and viruses are the most common causes of heart infections. Uncontrolled infections in the body can also harm the heart if they’re not properly treated.

## What are some risk factors for heart disease?

There are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable and others aren’t.

According to the CDC,around 47%of people in the United States have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Some of these risk factors include:

* high blood pressure

* high cholesteroland low levels ofhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol

* smoking

* obesity

* low physical activity

Smoking, for example, is a controllable risk factor. People who smoke double their chance of developing heart disease, according to theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

People with diabetes may also have a higher risk of heart disease because highblood glucose levelsincrease the chance of:

* angina

* heart attack

* stroke

* CAD

If you have diabetes, managing your glucose can limit your chance of developing heart disease. People with both high blood pressure and diabetes have ahigher riskof cardiovascular disease.

### Risk factors you can’t control

Other risk factors for heart disease include:

* family history

* ethnicity

* sex

* age

Although these risk factors aren’t controllable, you may be able to monitor their effects.

A family history of CAD is especially concerning ifit involves:

* a male relative under 55 years old

* a female relative under 65 years old

Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and people of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage have a higher risk than Native Alaskan or Native American people.

Also, males have a greater risk of heart disease than females. According to theCDC, the prevalence of heart disease is higher in men than in women.

## How is heart disease diagnosed?

Your doctor may order several types of tests and evaluations to make a heart disease diagnosis. Some of these tests can be performed before you ever have symptoms of heart disease.

Other tests may be used to look for possible causes of symptoms when they develop.

### Physical exams and blood tests

The first thing your doctor will do is perform aphysical exam. They will take an account of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing.

Then they will want to know yourfamilyand personal medical history. Genetics can play a role in some heart diseases. If you have a close family member with heart disease, share this information with your doctor.

Blood tests are frequently ordered. This is because they can help your doctor see yourcholesterol levelsand look for signs of inflammation.

### Noninvasive tests

A variety of noninvasive tests may be used to diagnose heart disease, such as:

* electrocardiogram (EKG)

* echocardiogram

* stress test

* carotid ultrasound

* Holter monitor

* tilt-table test

* CT scan

* heart MRI

### Invasive tests

If a physical exam, blood tests, and noninvasive tests aren’t conclusive, your doctor may want to look inside your body to determine what’s causing your symptoms. Invasive tests may include:

* cardiac catheterization

* coronary angiography

* electrophysiology

## What treatments are available for heart disease?

Treatment for heart disease largely depends on the type of heart disease you have as well as how far it has advanced. For example, if you have a heart infection, your doctor is likely to prescribe an antibiotic.

If you have plaque buildup, your doctor may take a two-pronged approach: prescribe a medication that can help lower your risk of additional plaque buildup and look to help you adopt certain lifestyle strategies.

Treatment for heart disease falls into three main categories:

### Lifestyle strategies

Some lifestyle strategies can help protect your heart. These include:

* eating a heart-healthy diet, such as theDASH diet

* gettingregular exercise

* quitting smoking

* limitingalcohol consumption

### Medications

A medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or manage your heart disease.

Your doctor may also prescribe medications that slow or stop the risk of complications. The exact drug you’re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have. Examples include:

* beta-blockers

* blood thinners

* calcium channel blockers

* ACE inhibitors

### Surgery or invasive procedures

In some cases of heart disease,surgeryor a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms.

For example, if you havearteries that are blockedentirely or almost completely by plaque buildup, your doctor may insert astentin your artery to return regular blood flow.

The procedure your doctor performs depends on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart.

## How can I prevent heart disease?

Some risk factors of heart disease can’t be controlled, like your family history. But it’s still important to lower your chance of developing heart disease by decreasing the risk factors you can control.

### Aim for healthy blood pressure and cholesterol numbers

Having healthy blood pressure and cholesterol ranges are some of the first steps you can take for a healthy heart. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

A healthy blood pressure is consideredless than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, which is often expressed as “120 over 80” or “120/80 mm Hg.”

Systolic is the measurement of pressure while the heart is contracting. Diastolic is the measurement when the heart is resting. Higher numbers indicate that the heart is working too hard to pump blood.

Your ideal cholesterol level depends on your risk factors and heart health history. If you have a high risk of heart disease, havediabetes, or have already had aheart attack, your target levels will be below those of people with low or average risk.

### Adopt heart-healthy lifestyle strategies

Practicing the same lifestyle strategies that can help you manage heart disease can also help reduce your chance of developing it.

Doctors recommend30–60 minutes of exerciseon most days for a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes each week. Check with your doctor to make sure you can safely meet these guidelines, especially if you already have a heart condition.

Quitting smoking can help your heart health because nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, making it harder for oxygenated blood to circulate. This can lead to atherosclerosis.

In addition,managing your stresscan help lower your chance for heart disease becausechronic stresscancontributeto the development of heart problems.

Making these changes all at once might not be possible, and that’s OK. Talk with your doctor about what will have the biggest impact right now. Even small steps toward these goals help keep you at your healthiest.

## Frequently asked questions

### What’s the connection between heart disease and hypertension?

High blood pressure (hypertension) makes the heart work harder to circulate blood. This can result in a thickened heart muscle and narrowed arteries.

High blood pressure also makes your heart muscles thicker and less elastic, impairing its ability to pump blood. This reduces the circulation of the oxygen-rich blood your body needs.

### Is there a cure for heart disease?

It’s not possible to cure or reverse heart disease, so it requires lifetime treatment and monitoring. But medications, procedures, and lifestyle strategies can relieve symptoms.

Coronary intervention orbypass surgerymight be used if other methods aren’t effective.

### Is sinus bradycardia a sign of heart disease?

Sinus bradycardiais an abnormally slow heart rate. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern on its own. In fact, it’s often a marker of a healthy heart in athletes or people who are young. But in some cases, itcan causeserious heart problems.

### What are the best exercises for a leaky heart valve?

If you have a leaky heart valve, walking regularly can be good exercise for your heart.

Do your bestto walk at a pace in which you are breathing hard and fast but can still carry on a conversation.

You can also do other aerobic exercises, such as swimming or cycling, following the same principle.

### Why are beta-blockers used in heart disease?

Beta-blockers slow and reduce the strength of your heartbeat. They also decrease your blood pressure. They work by blocking the hormoneadrenaline(epinephrine) from binding to beta receptors in your body.

## Takeaway

Almost half of all people in the United States have an elevated chance of developing heart disease, and the numbers continue to rise.

However, adopting heart-healthy lifestyle strategies can prevent or manage many cases of heart disease.

It’snot always easyto make these lifestyle changes in our busy and fast-paced lives, but there arehuge benefits. If you take care of your heart now, it’s more likely to take care of you later in life.

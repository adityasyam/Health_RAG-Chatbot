# Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting can be caused by many things, like pain, illness, and pregnancy. Seek medical care if your nausea and vomiting lasts longer than a week.

Vomitingis an uncontrollable reflex that expels the contents of the stomach through the mouth. It’s also called “being sick” or “throwing up.”Nauseais a term that describes the feeling that you might vomit but aren’t actually vomiting.

Both nausea and vomiting are very common symptoms and can be caused by a wide range of factors. They occur in both children and adults, although they’re probably most common in pregnant women and people undergoing cancer treatments.

## What causes nausea and vomiting?

Nausea and vomiting may occur together or separately. They can be caused by a number of physical and psychological conditions.

### Nausea

The most common causes of nausea are intense pain — usually from an injury or illness — and the first trimester ofpregnancy. There are also a number of other relatively common causes, including:

* motion sickness

* emotional stress

* indigestion

* food poisoning

* viruses

* exposure to chemical toxins

If you havegallstones, you’re also likely to feel nauseated.

You may find that certain smells bring on the feeling of nausea. This is a very common symptom during thefirst trimester of pregnancy, although it can also occur in people who aren’t pregnant. Pregnancy-induced nausea usually goes away by the second or third trimester.

### Vomiting in children

The most common causes of vomiting in children are viral infections and food poisoning. However, vomiting can also be caused by:

* severe motion sickness

* coughing

* high fevers

* overeating

In very young infants, blocked intestines can also cause persistent vomiting. The intestines may become blocked by abnormal muscular thickening,hernia, gallstones, or tumors. This is uncommon but should be investigated if unexplained vomiting occurs in an infant.

### Vomiting in adults

Most adults rarely vomit. When it does occur, a bacterial or viral infection or a type of food poisoning usually causes vomiting. In some cases, vomiting can also be the result of other illnesses, especially if they lead to aheadacheor highfever.

### Chronic stomach conditions

Chronic, or long-term, stomach conditions can often cause nausea and vomiting. These conditions can come along with other symptoms, such asdiarrhea,constipation, andstomach pain. These chronic conditions include food intolerances, such asceliac diseaseand dairy protein andlactose intolerance.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)is a common stomach condition that causes bloating, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, fatigue, and cramping. It occurs when parts of the gut become overactive. Doctors usually diagnose IBS by identifying symptoms and ruling out other stomach and bowel conditions.

Crohn’s diseaseis an inflammatory bowel disease that commonly affects the intestines, though it can occur anywhere in the digestive tract. Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own healthy gut tissue, causing inflammation, nausea, vomiting, and pain.

Doctors usually diagnose Crohn’s disease using acolonoscopy, a procedure that uses a small camera to explore the colon. Sometimes they also need a stool sample to help diagnose the condition.

### Lifestyle choices

Certain lifestyle choices can increase your chance of experiencing nausea and vomiting.

Consuming a large amount ofalcoholcan cause damage to the lining of the gut. Alcohol can also react with stomach acid. Both of these will cause nausea and vomiting. In some cases, excessive alcohol consumption can also cause bleeding in the digestive tract.

### Eating disorders

An eating disorder is when a person adjusts their eating habits and behaviors based on an unhealthy body image. It can cause nausea and vomiting.

Bulimiais an eating disorder in which a person induces vomiting deliberately to purge the stomach of any consumed food. People withanorexiamay also feel nausea due to starvation and excess stomach acid.

### Serious conditions

Though rare, vomiting can sometimes occur as a symptom of a more serious condition, including:

* meningitis

* appendicitis

* concussion

* abrain tumor

* migraines

If you’re persistently vomiting, go see your doctor.

## Potential complications of persistent vomiting

Most nausea and vomiting will clear up on its own, unless you have an underlying chronic condition.

However, persistent vomiting can cause dehydration andmalnutrition. You may also find that your hair and nails become weak and brittle, and that constant vomiting decays your tooth enamel.

## How can nausea and vomiting be prevented?

You can avoid nausea by eating smaller meals throughout the day, eating slowly, and resting after eating. Some people find that avoiding certain food groups and spicy foods prevents nausea.

If you start to feel nauseated, eat plain crackers before getting up and try to consume a high-protein food, such as cheese, lean meat, or nuts, before you go to sleep.

If you’re vomiting, try to drink small amounts of a sugary liquid, such as a soda or fruit juice. Drinking ginger ale or eating ginger can help settle your stomach. Avoid acidic juices, such as orange juice. They may upset your stomach further.

Over-the-counter medications, such asmeclizine(Bonine) and dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), can lessen the effects of motion sickness. Limit snacks during car rides and look straight out of a front window if you’re prone to motion sickness.

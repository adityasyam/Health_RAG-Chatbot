# What Do You Want to Know About Osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis does not always cause early signs or symptoms. Often you will only experience symptoms when the condition has advanced to the point where you break bones easily.

Like high blood pressure, osteoporosis is a silent disease. This means you will likely not notice any major changes in your health at first.

With osteoporosis, this often means a fracture or broken bone due to loss in bone density.

Your best chance at early detection is to know your risk factors and discuss screenings with a doctor.

## Early signs and symptoms of osteoporosis

Osteoporosisis knownas a “silent disease.” This is because it typically does not show early signs or symptoms. Often, you first discover you have the condition when you break a bone unexpectedly.

Still, some signs may be present that suggest bone loss, including:

* Brittle or weak nails:Nail health may suggest possible weakening bone health. However, a2018 studynoted that while this assessment is promising, using fingernails to diagnose bone health is still not practical yet.

* Poor oral health:Older researchhas shown some connection between osteoporosis and periodontal disease. Both are associated with bone loss and share some similar risk factors, including lack of vitamin D and smoking.

* Minimal grip strength:A2020 studyexamining postmenopausal women found that weaker grip strength increased the risk of falls and was associated with lower mineral density in the bones.

Since osteoporosis is unlikely to cause any obvious signs or symptoms, it’s best if you talk with a doctor if you have one or more risk factors, such as a family history of the disease.

## Late signs and symptoms of osteoporosis

Signs of osteoporosistypically don’tbecome obvious until the condition is quite advanced. Here are some potential signs and symptoms of late-stage osteoporosis.

### Spinal involvement

If osteoporosis affects the bones in the spine, you may notice:

* hunched or stooped posture

* back pain

* reduced height

* malformations in the spine

At this point, a doctor would be able to see changes in bone structure during a physical examination.

### Sudden break

Some people may spontaneously break a bone due to stress from various activities, such as coughing, stretching, or lifting heavy objects.

### Break from a minor fall

In some cases, you may discover you have osteoporosis if you have a minor fall or trip that causes you to break a bone when most people would not.

## What are the complications of osteoporosis?

Pathological fractures are themost serious and commoncomplication associated with osteoporosis. A pathological break means the break did not occur due to an outside force or stress.

Pathological fractures of the hips or spine are often the most problematic. They can lead to disability.

Severe fractures can also increase the risk of mortality or death.

Structural changes in the back, such as developing a hunched posture, is another possible complication.

## What are the risk factors for osteoporosis?

Common risk factors for osteoporosis include:

* advancing age

* bodyweight under 128 pounds

* smoking

* low levels of physical activity

* a personal history of a fracture from a ground-level fall or minor trauma after age 40

* being of white or Asian race

* having experienced early menopause

People assigned female at birth have a higher chance of developing primary osteoporosis. People assigned male at birth have a lower risk of primary osteoporosis but an increased risk of developing secondary osteoporosis from medication or other underlying causes.

Certain other medical conditions can increase your risk of osteoporosis, including:

* hyperparathyroidism

* anorexia

* malabsorption of nutrients

* hyperthyroidism

* overtreatment of hypothyroidism

* chronic renal failure

* Cushing syndrome

* any disease that can lead to long-term immobilization

* vitamin D deficiency

* living with diabetes

* a history of breast cancer

## The takeaway

Osteoporosis does not typically cause any early signs or symptoms. Signs often only occur once the disease has advanced to a point where your bones break easily.

Some of the most common symptoms involve spontaneous or stress-related breaks, such as from falls. Some people may also develop back pain and structural changes if it affects the spine.

If you have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, consider discussing your personal risks with a doctor. They may be able to start therapy or make recommendations for what you can do to slow its progression.

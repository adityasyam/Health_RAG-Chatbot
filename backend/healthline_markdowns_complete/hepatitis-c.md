# Everything You Want to Know About Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C is a viral condition that leads to inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C infections can be acute or chronic. A chronic infection can lead to serious complications, but appropriate treatment can usually cure the hepatitis virus.

## What is hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver that develops after contracting the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is bloodborne, which means you can only transmit or contract it through blood that carries it.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates around58 millionpeople globally are living with chronic hepatitis C.

In the United States, hepatitis C is among the most commontypes of hepatitis, along with hepatitis A and B. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B, but a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C doesn’t yet exist.

### Stages of hepatitis C

Hepatitis C can be either acute or chronic.

Doctors generally defineacute hepatitis Cas the first 6 months after infection. It is most often asymptomatic. Any symptoms you experience may appear within 2–12 weeks after exposure, and they could clear up on their own.

Chronic hepatitis Csymptoms, on the other hand, can develop (and worsen) over months or even years. You might not notice any symptoms until they become severe.

Left untreated, hepatitis C can cause serious, even life threatening complications, including:

* liver scarring (cirrhosis)

* liver failure

* liver cancer

## What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?

Symptoms may develop2–12 weeksafter exposure. The first 6 months after infection are considered acute.

Acute hepatitis C may cause:

* fever

* fatigue

* nausea or stomach pain

* loss of appetite

* yellowed skin or eyes (jaundice)

If your body doesn’t clear the virus, acute hepatitis C will become chronic. An estimated55–85%of people who contract HCV will eventually develop chronic hepatitis C.

Chronic hepatitis C may cause:

* difficulty concentrating or remembering things (brain fog)

* difficulty sleeping

* general weakness (malaise)

* joint pain andmuscle aches

* unexpectedmood changes, including feelings of anxiety or depression

* unexplained weight loss

These symptoms might affect you most of the time or improve for a while and then worsen.

With chronic hepatitis C, you could also notice some symptoms of liver scarring and liver disease, including:

* indigestion,bloating, andstomach pain

* swelling in your feet and legs (edema)

* stool that’s gray orpale

* urine that’sdarker than usual

## What causes hepatitis C, and who’s at risk?

Hepatitis C is a liver disease that occurs due to HCV infection. HCVtransmitsthrough blood-to-blood contact.

Thiscan happenas a result of:

* using nonsterile needles, syringes, and other supplies to inject or inhale

* pregnancy or childbirth

* oral, vaginal, or analsex without a condomor other barrier method

* getting a tattooor a piercing with nonsterile equipment

* sharing personal hygiene items, like razors or toothbrushes

You have an increased risk of HCV infection if you:

* have used injection drugs

* have asexual partnerwith hepatitis C

* haveHIV

* receivedhemodialysis treatmentfor an extended period

* received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992

* received clotting factor concentrates or other blood products before 1987

It’s important toconsult with a doctoror other healthcare professional if you suspect that you’ve had exposure to HCV. You can contract HCVmore than once.

## How is hepatitis C diagnosed?

Your healthcare professional will orderblood teststo check for the virus, starting with anantibody test.

If you’ve ever had an HCV infection, your body will make hepatitis C antibodies part of its immune response. It may take 2–3 months afterexposurefor the test to detect antibodies.

If the antibody test is positive, a nucleic acid test forribonucleic acid (RNA)can tell your healthcare professional whether the virus is currently active.

In the event of an active HCV infection, tests to measure theamount of virusin your blood (viral load) and determine whichgenotypeyou have will guide an effective treatment plan.

If blood test results suggest chronic hepatitis C or your healthcare professional believes you could have liver damage, they’ll order aliver function test. This test checks your blood for signs of heightened enzymes in your liver.

A type of scan called ultrasound elastography can be used to assess liver damage.

Aliver biopsycan also check for liver damage. A biopsy involves taking a small piece of tissue from your liver and testing it for cell abnormalities.

## How is hepatitis C treated?

Oralmedicationscalled direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) work toremove HCVfrom your body and reduce the risk of liver damage.

Treatment often includes two or more DAAs taken in combination. Some treatments are available as pills containing two or more drugs.

Common brand names include:

* Zepatier

* Harvoni

* Epclusa

* Vosevi

* Mavyret

A typical course oftreatmentlasts 12–24 weeks.

Treatmentcan curehepatitis C95% of the time. Healthcare professionalsconsiderthe condition cured when tests can’t detect the virus in your blood 12 weeks after treatment ends.

## What complications are possible with hepatitis C?

HCV infection causes liver inflammation. Over time,this damagecan cause permanent scarring, known as cirrhosis.

Cirrhosis interferes with blood flow and prevents your liver from functioning effectively. Anestimated 15–30%of people withchronic hepatitis Cdevelop cirrhosis within 20 years.

Untreated or unmanaged cirrhosis can lead to:

* increased pressure in the veins that supply blood to your liver (portal hypertension)

* fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites), which can lead to a severe infection called bacterialperitonitis

* fluid buildup in the legs (edema)

* an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)

* enlarged veins (varices) in the esophagus or stomach, which can lead to life threatening bleeding (variceal hemorrhage)

Advanced liver disease can also lead to:

* bone disease

* gum disease (periodontitis)

* liver cancer

* malnutrition

* toxin buildup in your brain (hepatic encephalopathy)

It takes a long time for chronic hepatitis C to causeliver failure. Liver failure or end stage liver disease, happens slowly over months, often years. When your liver becomes unable to function properly, you’ll need atransplant.

## What can you do to reduce your risk of HCV infection and hepatitis C?

Experts have yet to develop an effectivehepatitis C vaccine, thoughresearchcontinues.

Currently, the best way toreduce your risk of infectionis to avoid using any items that may have come into contact with someone else’s blood.

You can do this by:

* not sharing razors, nail clippers, toothbrushes, needles, or syringes

* only getting tattoos or piercings at licensed facilities

* wearing gloves when cleaning or treating someone else’s wound

* using condoms or other barrier methods during sex

If you think you could have hepatitis C, getting tested right away doesn’t just help you get treatment. It can also help you avoid transmitting the virus to others.

## The bottom line

You can contract HCV through blood-to-blood contact with someone who has the virus. While your body might clear an acute infection without treatment, hepatitis C often develops into a chronic condition.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the risk of long-term complications, including severe liver damage and liver failure.

Regular hepatitis C screenings can help with early detection. Consult with a healthcare professional to develop a screening schedule tailored to your individual level of risk.

# Everything You Need to Know About Allergies

An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance, or allergen, that’s not typically harmful to the body. Symptoms and treatments may vary depending on the type of allergy you have.

The immune system is responsible for keeping you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens.

It does this bycreating antibodiescalled immunoglobulin. There are several types of immunoglobulins, which fight against possible agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals. Immunoglobin E (IgE) is a type that responds to certain substances and causes an allergic reaction.

Allergic reactions may involve a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild inflammation to life threatening situations.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),1 in 3 peoplehave an allergy in the United States.

Keep reading to learn more about the types, symptoms, and causes of allergies, as well as how to treat them.

Sometimes, allergic reactions may cause symptoms that could be life threatening, known asanaphylaxis.

If you or someone you know suddenly experiences any of the following symptoms, call 911 or get immediate medical attention:

* swelling in the face, throat, and tongue

* dizziness, confusion, fainting

* difficulty breathing, swallowing, and speaking

* wheezing or coughing

* skin discoloration, such as blue, pale, or gray tongue

If you or the person has an epinephrine autoinjector, use it immediately. The shot counters allergic reactions until medical help arrives and could be lifesaving.

Learn more aboutallergy symptoms and what might cause them.

## Causes of allergies

It’s still unclear why the immune system causes an allergic reaction when a normally harmless foreign substance enters the body.

However, researchers have identified several factors that may contribute to allergies,including:

* older age

* genetics

* hormonal changes, especially in people assigned female at birth

* immunological factors, such as weakened immune system

* gut microbiome changes

* having other allergies, such as atopic dermatitis

Several common allergens have also been identified, including foods, medications, and environmental irritants. The cause of allergies may depend on how you come into contact with it:

* Ingestion:Foodslike nuts, cow’s milk, sesame, fish, tree nuts, and shellfish may cause allergies. Some oral medications likepenicillinmay also trigger a reaction.

* Inhaling:Severalenvironmental irritants, such as pollution, pet dander,mold, pollen, anddust mites, can trigger allergies.

* Direct contact:Some allergies are caused by direct contact with allergens, such as insect stings, the sun, certain plants, latex, and certain metals.

## How allergies are diagnosed

A doctor will first ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam.

They may ask about anything unusual you may have eaten recently and any substances you may have come in contact with. For example, if you have a rash on your hands, they may ask if you put on latex gloves recently.

To confirm an allergy, they may order several tests,including:

* Blood test:This can help detect the presence of IgE, which are cells that react to allergens.

* Skin prick test:Small amounts of an allergen are pricked, brushed, or scratched against your skin to see if there’s an allergic reaction.

Learn more aboutallergy testing and diagnosis.

## Allergy treatments

Avoiding the allergen that triggers the reaction is the best way to prevent allergies. If that’s not possible, there are treatment options available.

### Medication

Allergy treatment usually includes over-the-counter or prescription medications, whichare availableas nasal sprays, pills, liquids, and topical ointments.

Some allergy medications mayinclude:

* antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin), andcetirizine(Zyrtec)

* corticosteroids

* decongestants(Afrin, Suphedrine PE, Sudafed)

* mast cell stabilizers, which stop mast cells from releasing histamine

It’s important to work with a healthcare professional to develop the best management plan for your allergies.

### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a treatment that involves administering small doses of an allergen to help your body become used to it over time.

There aretwo typesof immunotherapy:

* Injections:This involves several injections over a few years. It’s most helpful for allergens like pollen, pet dander, insect stings, and asthma.

* Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT):This involves placing small doses of allergens under your tongue. It’s best for asthma and nasal allergies, such as dust mites, ragweed, andgrass.

Successful immunotherapy can prevent allergy symptoms from returning.

### Emergency epinephrine

If you have a severe, life threatening allergy, you’ll most likely have to carry an emergency epinephrine autoinjector. This is thefirst-line treatmentfor anaphylaxis.

This shot counters allergic reactions until medical help arrives. Common brands of this treatmentinclude:

* Epipen

* Twinject

* Emerade

* Jext

### Natural remedies

Several natural remedies and supplements could help relieve allergy symptoms. These may include:

* saline irrigation

* cleaning the air filters in your home

* using a humidifier

* tryingessential oils

* modifying your diet

It’s important to note that limited research supports the efficacy of these natural remedies. They should be used alongside medical treatments, such as medication and immunotherapy.

Some home remedies may also trigger allergy symptoms in some people. For instance, some dried teas use flowers and plants closely related to plants that might be causing you to sneeze.

## Preventing symptoms

There’s no way to prevent allergies from developing, but there are ways to prevent symptoms.

The best way to prevent allergy symptoms is to avoid the allergens that trigger them.

* following your allergy treatment plan, such as taking medications

* trying an elimination diet

* reading food labels

* asking questions about ingredients when dining out

* installing proper air filters in your home

* regularly dusting your home

## Complications of allergies

The most severe complication of allergies is anaphylaxis.

If not treated immediately, anaphylaxis may lead to death in less than5 minutes.

Allergies and allergy treatments may lead to complications that affect your heart, circulation, and breathing. For instance, people with heart disease are at a greater risk of heart attack.

If you have allergies, speak with a healthcare professional about potential complications. They could help develop the best management plan for you.

## Allergies vs. other conditions

Allergies may be associated with other conditions or cause similar symptoms.

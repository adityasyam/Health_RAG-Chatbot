The type of eczema you have can determine what type of rash you develop and where on your body it occurs.\n\nEczema is also called atopic dermatitis.

Keep reading to learn more about eczema, including its causes, how to treat flares, and how to prevent them.",
        "## What causes eczema?\n\nThe cause of eczema isn’t completely understood. However, researchers think that it’s triggered by an overactive immune system.\n\nEczema tends to flare when your skin is exposed to external irritants, which cause your immune system to overreact. We’ve listed common triggers for flare-ups below.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have found that some people with eczema don’t make enough of a protein called filaggrin (filament aggregating protein). This protein is responsible for helping your skin stay moisturized and healthy.",
        "### Eczema triggers\n\nAneczema flare-uphappens when one or more eczema symptoms appear on the skin. According to theNational Health Service (NHS), research has shown that external and internal factors can contribute to flares of eczema. Common triggers include:\n\n* chemicals or preservatives found in cleansers and detergents\n\n* scented products\n\n* cigarette smoke\n\n* external allergens such as pollens, mold, dust, or dust mites\n\n* rough scratchy material, like wool\n\n* synthetic fabrics\n\n* sweating\n\n* temperature changes\n\n* stress\n\n* food allergies\n\n* animal dander\n\n* upper respiratory infections",

Scratching eczema further irritates and inflames the skin. This can cause infections that must be treated with antibiotics.\n\nSometimes, mild eczema can be managed at home by avoiding triggers and keeping skin moisturized.

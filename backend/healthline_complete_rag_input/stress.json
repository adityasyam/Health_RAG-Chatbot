        "# Everything You Need to Know About Stress\n\nStress is a biological response to a perceived threat. It’s caused by chemicals and hormones surging throughout your body. It can help you respond to a particular problem, but too much can harm your health.\n\nStresstriggers your fight-or-flight response in order to fight the stressor or run away from it. Typically, after the response occurs, your body should relax. Too much constant stress can have negative effects.",
        "### Is all stress bad?\n\nStress isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s what helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive, and it’s just as important in today’s world. It can be healthy when it helps you avoid an accident, meet a tight deadline, or keep your wits about you amid chaos.\n\nWe all feel stressed at times, but what one person finds stressful may be very different from what another finds stressful. An example of this would be public speaking. Some love the thrill of it and others become paralyzed at the very thought.\n\nStress isn’t always a bad thing, either. Your wedding day, for example, may be considered a good form of stress.\n\nBut stress should be temporary. Once you’ve passed the fight-or-flight moment, your heart rate and breathing should slow down and your muscles should relax. In a short time, your body should return to its natural state without any lasting negative effects.\n\nOn the other hand, severe, frequent, or prolonged stress can bementally and physically harmful.\n\nAnd it’s fairly common. When asked,80 percentof Americans reported they’d had at least onesymptom of stressin the past month.Twenty percentreported being under extreme stress.\n\nLife being what it is, it’s not possible to eliminate stress completely. But we can learn to avoid it when possible and manage it when it’s unavoidable.",
        "## Defining stress\n\nStress is a normal biological reaction to a potentially dangerous situation. When you encounter sudden stress, your brain floods your body with chemicals and hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nThat gets your heart beating faster and sends blood to muscles and important organs. You feel energized and have heightened awareness so you can focus on your immediate needs.These are the different stages of stress and how people adapt.",
        "## Stress hormones\n\nWhen you sense danger, thehypothalamusat the base of your brain reacts. It sends nerve and hormone signals to youradrenal glands, which release an abundance of hormones.\n\nThese hormones are nature’s way of preparing you to face danger and increase your chances of survival.\n\nOne of these hormones is adrenaline. You might also know it as epinephrine, or the fight-or-flight hormone. In rapid fashion, adrenaline works to:\n\n* increase your heartbeat\n\n* increase your breathing rate\n\n* make it easier for your muscles to useglucose\n\n* contract blood vessels so blood is directed to the muscles\n\n* stimulate perspiration\n\n* inhibitinsulinproduction\n\nWhile this is helpful in the moment, frequent adrenaline surges can lead to:\n\n* damaged blood vessels\n\n* high blood pressure, or hypertension\n\n* higher risk ofheart attackandstroke\n\n* headaches\n\n* anxiety\n\n* insomnia\n\n* weight gain\n\nHere’s what else you should know about an adrenaline rush.\n\nAlthough adrenaline is important, it isn’t the primary stress hormone. That’s cortisol.",
        "## Stress and cortisol\n\nAs the main stress hormone, cortisol plays an essential role in stressful situations. Among its functions are:\n\n* raising the amount of glucose in your bloodstream\n\n* helping the brain use glucose more effectively\n\n* raising the accessibility of substances that help with tissue repair\n\n* restraining functions that are nonessential in a life-threatening situation\n\n* altering immune system response\n\n* dampening the reproductive system and growth process\n\n* affecting parts of the brain that control fear, motivation, and mood\n\nAll this helps you deal more effectively with a high-stress situation. It’s a normal process and crucial to human survival.\n\nBut if your cortisol levels stay high for too long, it has a negative impact on your health. It can contribute to:\n\n* weight gain\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* sleep problems\n\n* lack of energy\n\n* type 2 diabetes\n\n* osteoporosis\n\n* mental cloudiness (brain fog) and memory problems\n\n* a weakened immune system, leaving you more vulnerable to infections\n\nIt can also have a negative impact on your mood.You can lower your cortisol levels naturally: Here’s how.",
        "## Types of stress\n\nThere are severaltypes of stress, including:\n\n* acute stress\n\n* episodic acute stress\n\n* chronic stress",
        "### Acute stress\n\nAcute stress happens to everyone. It’s the body’s immediate reaction to a new and challenging situation. It’s the kind of stress you might feel when you narrowly escape a car accident.\n\nAcute stress can also come out of something that you actually enjoy. It’s the somewhat-frightening, yet thrilling feeling you get on a roller coaster or when skiing down a steep mountain slope.\n\nThese incidents of acute stress don’t normally do you any harm. They might even be good for you. Stressful situations give your body and brain practice in developing the best response to future stressful situations.\n\nOnce the danger passes, your body systems should return to normal.\n\nSevere acute stressis a different story. This kind of stress, such as when you’ve faced a life-threatening situation, can lead topost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)or other mental health problems.",
        "### Episodic acute stress\n\nEpisodic acute stress is when you have frequent episodes of acute stress.\n\nThis might happen if you’re often anxious and worried about things you suspect may happen. You might feel that your life is chaotic and you seemingly go from one crisis to the next.\n\nCertain professions, such as law enforcement or firefighters, might also lead to frequent high-stress situations.\n\nAs with severe acute stress, episodic acute stress can affect your physical health and mental well-being.",
        "### Chronic stress\n\nWhen you have high-stress levels for an extended period of time, you have chronic stress. Long-term stress like this can have a negative impact on your health. It may contribute to:\n\n* anxiety\n\n* cardiovascular disease\n\n* depression\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* a weakened immune system\n\nChronic stress can also lead to frequent ailments such as headaches, an upset stomach, and sleep difficulties.Gaining insights into the different types of stress and how to recognize them may help.",

        "## Overview\n\nFever is also known as hyperthermia, pyrexia, or elevated temperature. It describes a body temperature that’s higher than normal. Fever can affect children and adults.\n\nA short-term increase in body temperature can help your body fight off illness. However, a severe fever can be a symptom of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.",
        "## What to look for\n\nRecognizing a fever can enable you to get treatment and proper monitoring for it. Normal body temperature is typically around 98.6°F (37°C). However, the normal body temperature for each person can vary slightly.\n\nNormal body temperature may also fluctuate depending on the time of day. It tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nOther factors, such as yourmenstrual cycleor intense exercise, can also affect body temperature.\n\nTo check you or your child’s temperature, you can use an oral, rectal, or axillary thermometer.\n\nAn oral thermometer should be placed under the tongue for three minutes.\n\nShop for oral thermometers.\n\nYou may also use an oral thermometer for an axillary, or armpit, reading. Simply place the thermometer in the armpit and cross your arms or your child’s arms over the chest. Wait four to five minutes before removing the thermometer.\n\nA rectal thermometer may be used for measuring body temperature in infants. To do this:\n\n* Place a small amount of petroleum jelly on the bulb.\n\n* Lay your baby on their stomach and gently insert the thermometer about 1 inch into their rectum.\n\n* Hold the bulb and your baby still for at least three minutes.\n\nFind a selection of rectal thermometers online.\n\nIn general, a baby has a fever when their body temperature exceeds 100.4°F (38°C). A child has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99.5°F (37.5°C). An adult has a fever when their temperature exceeds 99–99.5°F (37.2–37.5°C).",

        "## How to treat a fever at home\n\nCare for a fever depends on its severity. A low-grade fever with no other symptoms doesn’t typically require medical treatment. Drinking fluids and resting in bed are usually enough to fight off a fever.\n\nWhen a fever is accompanied by mild symptoms, such as general discomfort or dehydration, it can be helpful to treat elevated body temperature by:\n\n* making sure the room temperature where the person is resting is comfortable\n\n* taking a regular bath or a sponge bath using lukewarm water\n\n* takingacetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil)\n\n* drinking plenty of fluids\n\nPurchaseacetaminophenoribuprofenonline.",

    "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition affecting the central nervous system, where the immune system attacks myelin. There is no cure, but treatments can manage symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, and speech issues, among others. While MS is not hereditary, having a close relative with MS increases risk. Treatments include disease-modifying therapies and other medications to manage specific symptoms, although MS isn't life-threatening, it presents unique challenges.",

        "# Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\nMultiple sclerosis affects the brain and spinal cord and causes symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty walking, and speech issues. There’s no cure yet, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition involving your central nervous system (CNS). With MS, your immune system attacks myelin, which is the protective layer around nerve fibers.\n\nMS causes inflammation and temporary lesions. It can also lead to lasting lesions caused by scar tissue, which interferes with messages in the affected areas of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nThere’s no cure for MS, but it’s possible to manage symptoms. Learn more about the causes of MS, how it’s treated, and more.",
        "## What are the symptoms of MS?\n\nPeople with MS experience a wide range of symptoms. Due to the nature of the disease, symptoms can vary widely from person to person.\n\nThey can also change in severity over time and even from day to day.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms associated with MS include:",
        "### Fatigue\n\nAround80%of people with MS report having fatigue, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). Fatigue due to MS can make it harder to do everyday tasks.",
        "### Difficulty walking\n\nDifficulty walking can occur with MS due to:\n\n* numbness in your legs or feet\n\n* difficulty balancing\n\n* muscle weakness\n\n* muscle spasticity\n\n* difficulty with vision\n\nDifficulty walking can also lead to injuries if you fall.",
        "### Vision problems\n\nVision problemsare often some of the first symptoms for many people with MS. They may affect one or both eyes. These issues may come and go, get worse over time, or resolve entirely.\n\nCommon vision problems associated with MS include:\n\n* optic neuritis, which can cause pain or blurry vision in one eye\n\n* diplopia, or double vision\n\n* nystagmus, or involuntary movement of the eyes\n\n* loss of vision in one visual field or both eyes\n\n* blindness",
        "### Speech issues\n\nMS lesions in the brain can affect speech. These speech issues, also known asdysarthria, can range from mild to severe.\n\nSymptoms of dysarthria can include:\n\n* slurred speech\n\n* “scanning” speech, where there are long pauses between words or syllables\n\n* changes in the volume of speech",
        "### Other symptoms\n\nOther common symptoms of MS can include:\n\n* acute or chronic pain\n\n* tremors\n\n* cognitive issues involving concentration, memory, and word-finding\n\n* difficulty chewing and swallowing\n\n* sleep issues\n\n* problems with bladder control\n\nLearn more about the symptoms of MS.",
        "## What are the early signs of MS?\n\nMS can begin with mild to severe symptoms, and it can progress slowly or rapidly. Three of the most common early symptoms of MS are:\n\n* Numbness and tingling that affects the arms, legs, or one side of your face:These sensations are similar to the pins-and-needles feeling you get when your foot falls asleep. However, they occur without a trigger.\n\n* Uneven balance and weak legs:You may find yourself tripping easily while walking or doing some other type of physical activity.\n\n* Double vision, blurry vision in one eye, or partial vision loss:These symptoms can be early indicators of MS. You may also have eye pain.\n\nThese early symptoms may go away only to return later. You may go weeks, months, or even years betweenflare-ups.\n\nThese symptoms can have many different causes. Even if you have these symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have MS.\n\nLearn about the early signs of MS.",
        "## How is MS diagnosed?\n\nA healthcare professional, often a neurologist, performs a neurological exam to diagnose MS. They typically also talk with you about your clinical history and order tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDiagnostic testing may include:\n\n* MRI scan:Using a contrast dye with theMRIallows your doctor to detect active and inactive lesions throughout your brain and spinal cord.\n\n* Optical coherence tomography (OCT):In this test, a picture of the nerve layers in the back of your eye is taken to check for thinning around the optic nerve.\n\n* Spinal tap (lumbar puncture):Your doctor may order aspinal tapto find abnormalities in your spinal fluid. This test can help rule out infectious diseases. It can also be used to look for oligoclonal bands (OCBs), which can be used to diagnose MS.\n\n* Blood tests:Doctors orderblood teststo help eliminate the possibility of other conditions that have similar symptoms.\n\n* Visual evoked potentials (VEP) test:This test stimulates the nerve pathways to analyze electrical activity in your brain.Brain stem auditory-evokedand sensory-evoked potential tests may also be used to diagnose MS.\n\nAn MS diagnosis requires evidence ofdemyelinationoccurring at different times in more than one area of your brain, spinal cord, or optic nerves.\n\nDamage to the protective myelin layer around your nerves is called demyelination. It prevents your nervous system from efficiently sending signals in the areas that are affected.\n\nA diagnosis also requires ruling out other conditions that have similar symptoms, such as:\n\n* Lyme disease\n\n* lupus\n\n* Sjögren disease\n\nLearn more about the tests used to diagnose MS.",
        "## What are the types of MS?\n\nYour MS may change and evolve. You can only have one type of MS at a time, but knowing when you transition to a progressive form of MS may be difficult to pinpoint.\n\nTypes of MS include:",
        "### Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)\n\nCISis a pre-MS condition involving one episode of symptoms lasting at least 24 hours. These symptoms are due to demyelination in your CNS.\n\nAlthough this episode is characteristic of MS, it’s not enough to prompt a diagnosis. CIS can fully resolve, and a person can have a single episode without any future episodes.\n\nIf you have more than one lesion or positive oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in your spinal fluid at the time of a spinal tap, then you might be more likely to eventually be diagnosed with RRMS. If you have evidence of a previous lesion, you might be diagnosed with RRMS during the evaluation for CIS.\n\nIf these lesions are absent or your spinal fluid does not show OCBs, you are less likely to receive an MS diagnosis.",
        "### Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)involves clear relapses of disease activity followed by remissions. During remission periods, symptoms are mild or absent, and there’s mild to moderate disease progression.\n\nRRMS is the most common form of MS at diagnosis and accounts forabout 85%of all initial MS diagnoses, according to the NMSS.",
        "### Primary progressive MS (PPMS)\n\nIf you haveprimary progressive MS (PPMS), neurological function becomes progressively worse from the onset of your symptoms.\n\nHowever, short periods of stability can occur. The terms “active” and “not active” are sometimes used to describe disease activity with new or enhancing brain lesions.",
        "### Secondary progressive MS (SPMS)\n\nSecondary progressive MS (SPMS)occurs when RRMS transitions into the progressive form. In addition to disability or gradual worsening of function, you may still have noticeable relapses.\n\nFind out more about the different types of MS.",
        "## What causes MS?\n\nIf you have MS, the protective layer of myelin around some of the nerve fibers of your brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord become damaged.\n\nSee illustrations that show these physiological changes.\n\nExperts think that this damage may result from an autoimmune process in which the immune system targets myelin. While more research is needed, an environmental trigger, such as a virus or toxin, may set off this process.\n\nAs your immune system damages the myelin, demyelination occurs. This can go into remission as new layers of myelin form, but chronic inflammation can lead to scar tissue, which can result in lasting neurological impairment.\n\nMS is not hereditary, but havinga parent or siblingwith MS raises your risk slightly. Scientists have identified some genes that seem to increase susceptibility to developing MS, according to a review of studiespublished in 2011.\n\nExperts do not know why some people develop MS. However, several risk factors may increase the risk.\n\nThese include:\n\n* having a close relative with MS\n\n* obesity\n\n* certain infections\n\n* smoking\n\n* certain autoimmune disorders, such astype 1 diabetesandrheumatoid arthritis\n\nFind out more about the possible causes of MS.",
        "## How do doctors treat MS?\n\nNo cure is currently available for MS, but treatment options can limit relapses or slow progression. Other medications and therapies can help manage specific symptoms.",
        "### Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)\n\nDMTshelp slow the progression of MS and reduce your relapse rate.\n\nSelf-injectable disease-modifying medications for RRMS includeglatiramer acetate (Copaxone)and beta interferons, such as:\n\n* Avonex\n\n* Betaseron\n\n* Extavia\n\n* Plegridy\n\n* Rebif\n\nIn 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Kesimpta for treatment. Kesimpta is an injectable monoclonal antibody treatment that can be self-administered.\n\nOral medications for RRMS include:\n\n* dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)\n\n* fingolimod (Gilenya)\n\n* teriflunomide (Aubagio)\n\n* cladribine (Mavenclad)\n\n* diroximel fumarate (Vumerity)\n\n* siponimod (Mayzent)\n\n* ozanimod (Zeposia)\n\n* monomethyl fumerate (Bafiertam)\n\n* ponesimod (Ponvory)\n\nIntravenous (IV) infusion treatmentsfor RRMS include:\n\n* alemtuzumab (Lemtrada)\n\n* natalizumab (Tysabri)\n\n* mitoxantrone (Novantrone)\n\n* Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus)\n\nIn 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DMT for people with PPMS. This infusion drug,ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), can also be used to treat RRMS.\n\nAnother drug, ozanimod (Zeposia), has recently been approved for treating CIS, RRMS, and SPMS.\n\nNot allMS medicationsare available or appropriate for every person. Talk with your doctor about which drugs are most appropriate for you and the risks and benefits of each.",
        "### Other medications\n\nA doctor can prescribecorticosteroids, such asmethylprednisolone(Medrol) or Acthar Gel (ACTH), to treat relapses.\n\nOther treatments may also be targeted at easing specific symptoms to help improve your quality of life, such as helping to treat pain or bladder urgency.\n\nBecause MS is different for everyone, treatment depends on your specific symptoms.\n\nGet more information on treatments for MS.",
        "## What is the life expectancy of someone with MS?\n\nMost peoplewith MS have a normal life expectancy. While MS is not a terminal illness, some complications associated with it can be life threatening.\n\nProgressive types of MS generally advance faster than RRMS. People with RRMS can be in remission for many years. A lack of disability after 5 years is usually a good indicator for the future.\n\nMost people with MS don’t become severely disabled and continue to lead full lives.\n\nTake a closer look at the prognosis for people with MS.",
        "## Can you live a regular life with MS?\n\nYour quality of life with MS will depend on your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment. But even though MS can change course without warning, it’s rarely fatal.\n\nMost people with MS find ways to manage their symptoms and function well.",
        "### Medications\n\nHaving MS means you’ll need adoctor experienced in treating MS.\n\nIf you take one of the DMTs, you’ll need to adhere to the recommended schedule. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to treat specific symptoms.",
        "### Diet and exercise\n\nRegular physical activity, such as exercise, supports your overall health, physically and mentally.\n\nIf physical movement is difficult,swimmingor exercising in a swimming pool can help. Some yoga classes are designed just for people with MS.\n\nAwell-balanced dietthat’s high innutrientsand fiber can also help you manage your overall health.\n\nYour diet should mainly consist of:\n\n* a variety offruitsandvegetables\n\n* lean sources ofprotein, such asfishandskinless poultry\n\n* whole grainsandother sources of fiber\n\n* nuts\n\n* legumes\n\n* low fat dairy products\n\n* adequate amounts ofwaterand other fluids\n\nThe more nutritious your diet, the better it supports your overall health. You’ll not only feel better in the short term, but you’ll also be laying the foundation for a healthier future.\n\nIt’s important that you try tolimit or avoid:\n\n* saturated fat\n\n* trans fat\n\n* red meats\n\n* foods and beverages high in sugar\n\n* foods high in sodium\n\n* highly processed foods\n\nIf you have other medical conditions, ask your doctor if you should follow a special diet or take any dietary supplements.\n\nIt’s helpful to learn how toread food labelsproperly. Foods that are high in calories but low in nutrients will not help you feel better or maintain a weight that works for you.",
        "### Other complementary therapies\n\nAlthough studies regarding the effectiveness of complementary therapies are scarce, that does not mean these methods can’t help in some way.\n\nThe following therapiesmay helpyou feel less stressed and more relaxed:\n\n* meditation\n\n* massage\n\n* tai chi\n\n* acupuncture\n\n* hypnotherapy",
        "## What are the complications of MS?\n\nMS lesions can appear anywhere in your CNS and have wide-ranging effects. Many people with MS also have:\n\n* depression\n\n* anxiety\n\n* some degree of cognitive impairment\n\n* muscle spasticity or stiffness\n\n* muscle atrophy or thinning\n\nIf you have other medical conditions, MS can have a more substantial impact on your overall health.\n\nIf you have mobility issues, falling may increase your risk ofbone fractures. Other conditions, such asarthritisandosteoporosis, can complicate matters. Mobility issues can lead to a lack of physical activity, which can cause other health problems. Fatigue and mobility issues may also have an effect on mental health.\n\nDiscover more effects of MS.",
        "## What are the statistics on MS?\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that around400,000 peoplein the United States have MS.\n\nOther things you should know:\n\n* NMSS reports that most people diagnosed with RRMS arebetween ages 20 and 50at the time of their diagnosis.\n\n* Overall, research indicates that MS ismore common in femalesthan males. NMSS reports that RRMS specifically isthree timesmore common in females than males. PPMS rates in females and males are roughly equal.\n\n* Research shows that people who relocate to a new locationbefore age 15 yearsgenerally acquire the MS risk factors associated with the new location, compared with those relocating after age 15 years. Canada has one of the highest rates of MS in the world. Rates of MS tend to be lower in places closer to the equator. This may be due tosunlightandvitamin Dexposure.\n\nCheck out more MS facts and statistics here.",
        "## Takeaway\n\nMS is a lifelong condition. You’ll face unique challenges that can change over time.\n\nIt’s helpful for you to discuss your concerns with your doctor. Doing so, enables you to learn all you can about MS and to discover what makes you feel your best.\n\nMany people with MS even choose to share their challenges and coping strategies through in-person oronlinesupport groups.\n\nYou can also try Healthline’s free MS Buddy app to share advice and support in an open environment.

    "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prevalent heart condition caused by plaque buildup in arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart. Symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath. Medications and lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are primary treatments. The disease affects millions and is a leading cause of heart attacks.",

        "# What Is Coronary Artery Disease?\n\nCoronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. It happens when something, like plaque buildup, reduces blood flow to the heart. It can increase your risk of heart attack.\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) causes impaired blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), CAD is the most common form ofheart diseaseand affects approximately16.5 millionAmericans over the age of 20.\n\nIt’s also theleading cause of deathfor both men and women in the United States. It’s estimated that every36 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack.\n\nAheart attackcan come from uncontrolled CAD.",
        "## Coronary artery disease symptoms\n\nWhen your heart doesn’t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms.Angina(chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as:\n\n* chest pain\n\n* heaviness\n\n* tightness\n\n* burning\n\n* squeezing\n\nThese symptoms can also be mistaken forheartburnorindigestion.\n\nOther symptoms of CAD include:\n\n* pain in thearmsorshoulders\n\n* shortness of breath\n\n* sweating\n\n* dizziness\n\nYou may experiencemore symptomswhen your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack.\n\nDon’t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary.",
        "### Symptoms of CAD for women\n\nWomen may also experience the above symptoms, but they’re also more likely to have:\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* back pain\n\n* jaw pain\n\n* shortness of breath without feeling chest pain\n\nMen have ahigher riskof developing heart disease than women, however.\n\nDue to decreased blood flow, your heart may also:\n\n* become weak\n\n* develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates\n\n* fail to pump as much blood as your body needs\n\nYour doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis.",
        "## Causes of coronary artery disease\n\nThe most common cause of CAD is a vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known asatherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked.\n\nOther rare causesof damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart.",
        "## Coronary artery disease risk factors\n\nUnderstanding therisk factorsfor CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease.\n\nRisk factors include:\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* high blood cholesterol levels\n\n* tobaccosmoking\n\n* insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetesmellitus\n\n* obesity\n\n* inactivity\n\n* unhealthy eating habits\n\n* obstructive sleep apnea\n\n* emotional stress\n\n* excessive alcohol consumption\n\n* history ofpreeclampsiaduring pregnancy\n\nThe risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning atage 45and women have a greater risk beginning atage 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease.",
        "## Coronary artery disease diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing CADrequires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:\n\n* Electrocardiogram:This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you’ve had a heart attack.\n\n* Echocardiogram:This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.\n\n* Stress test:This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart’s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.\n\n* Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization):During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.\n\n* Heart CT scan:Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries.",
        "## Coronary artery disease anatomy\n\nThe four primary coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart:\n\n* right main coronary artery\n\n* left main coronary artery\n\n* left circumflex artery\n\n* left anterior descending artery\n\nThese arteries bring oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to yourheart. Your heart is a muscle that’s responsible for pumping blood throughout your body and needs oxygen all the time. Ahealthy heartmoves approximately 3,000 gallons of blood through your body every day.\n\nLike any other organ or muscle, your heart must receive an adequate, dependable supply of blood in order to carry out its work. Reduced blood flow to your heart can cause symptoms of CAD.",
        "## What is the treatment for CAD?\n\nIt’s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you’re diagnosed with CAD.\n\nTreatmentalso depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.\n\nMedications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here.\n\nLifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:\n\n* quit smoking tobacco\n\n* reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol\n\n* exercise regularly\n\n* lose weight to a healthy level\n\n* eat ahealthy diet(low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar)\n\nIf your condition doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:\n\n* balloon angioplasty:to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure\n\n* coronary artery bypass graft surgery:to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery\n\n* enhanced external counterpulsation:to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure",
        "## What is the outlook for CAD?\n\nEveryone’s outlook for CAD is different. You have better chances of preventingextensive damageto your heart the earlier you can start your treatment or implement lifestyle changes.\n\nIt is important to follow your doctor’s instructions. Take medications as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. If you have a higher risk for CAD, you can help topreventthe disease by reducing your risk factors.",

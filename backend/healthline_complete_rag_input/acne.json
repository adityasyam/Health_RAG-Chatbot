The most common sites include the face and neck, shoulders, back, and chest.\n\nYour skin has tiny holes called pores that can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dirt. When this occurs, you may develop a pimple, sometimes also called a zit or blemish.\n\nIf you get pimples often, especially several at once repeatedly, you may haveacne. In other words, acne is the skin conditionthat causes pimples.\n\nAcne is very common. In fact, research estimates that9.4 percentof people worldwide have acne. In the United States, acne is the most common skin condition, according to theAmerican Academy of Dermatology (AAD).\n\nWhile acne doesn’t pose a serious risk to your overall health, it can still be painful, particularly if you have severe acne. Over time, acne might also cause scarring.\n\nThere’s no denying that acne can contribute to emotional distress. Acne and acne scars on your face and other visible body locations can affect self-esteem and self-confidence, and they can even contribute tofeelings of anxiety or depression.\n\nIf you live with acne, know that it’s a common condition.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that acne is very treatable. A number of effective treatments exist, so you have options for reducing the number of pimples you get and minimizing your chances of scarring.",
        "## What are the different types of acne?\n\nIf you have acne, you might notice amix of pimple types.\n\nWhiteheadsandblackheads, both also referred to as comedones, are the most common acne lesions.\n\n* Blackheads, or open comedones, open at the surface of your skin. Oxygen in the air (not dirt) gives the top of these pimples their darker appearance.\n\n* Whiteheads, or closed comedones, form as raised bumps under the surface of your skin. They remain flesh-colored.\n\nInflammatorylesions, which are more likely to cause scarring of your skin, include:\n\n* Papules.These small, red, raised bumps are caused by inflamed or infected hair follicles.\n\n* Pustules.These small red pimples have pus at their tips.\n\n* Nodules.These solid, often painful lumps develop beneath the surface of your skin.\n\n* Cysts.These large lumps beneath your skin contain pus and are usually painful.",
        "## What are the symptoms of acne?\n\nAcne can be found almost anywhere on your body, but you’ll most commonly notice breakouts on your:\n\n* face and neck\n\n* back\n\n* shoulders\n\n* chest\n\nPimples can give your skin a rough, uneven texture.\n\nWith acne, you might also experience:\n\n* skin discoloration, including dark patches or spots (hyperpigmentation) and redness\n\n* swellingand inflammation\n\n* pain and tenderness when touched or not\n\nAcne breakouts can also causescarringor discoloration on your skin.\n\nPopping pimples can raise your chances of scarring, so avoid squeezing — no matter how tempting it feels to get rid of the pimple immediately — andtry these tips.\n\nOnce a pimple develops, it can take anywhere froma few days to several weeksto completely clear up.An acne breakout can take a lot longer to heal and clear, especially without treatment.",
        "## What causes acne?\n\nAcne occurs when the pores of your skin become blocked with oil, dead skin, or bacteria.\n\nEach pore of your skin opens to a follicle. The follicle is made up of a hair and a sebaceous (oil) gland.\n\nThe oil gland releasessebum(oil), which travels up the hair, out of the pore, and onto your skin. Sebum helps keeps your skin lubricated and soft.\n\nOne or more mishaps in this lubrication process can contribute to acne.\n\nAcne might occur, for example, when:\n\n* your follicles produce too much oil\n\n* dead skin cells accumulate in your pores\n\n* bacteria build up in your pores\n\nAny of these concerns can lead to pimples, which develop when bacteria grow in a clogged pore and the oil can’t escape.",
        "## What are the risk factors for developing acne?\n\nExperts still don’t know exactly why some people experience acne and others don’t.\n\nThat said, they do recognize a number of risk factors can contribute to or worsen acne, including:\n\n* hormonal changes due to pregnancy or puberty\n\n* polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)and other endocrine conditions\n\n* cigarette smoking\n\n* poor sleep\n\n* stress\n\n* cleansers, creams, moisturizers, and other beauty productswith high oil content\n\n* certain medications, includinglithium, some types of hormonal birth control, anticonvulsants, andsteroids\n\n* a family history of acne\n\nYou have the highest risk of developing acne during puberty. During this time, your body undergoes many hormonal changes. These changes can trigger oil production, leading to an increased risk of acne. Hormonal acne related to puberty usually improves when you reach adulthood, and your breakouts may even stop completely.\n\nAccording to a2021 review, certain foods or diets may have an effect on acne:\n\n* Low glycemic index diet.Cutting back on foods with a high glycemic index, such as refined carbs and added sugars, couldhelp reduceacne lesions.\n\n* Milk products.Consuming certain milk products, like milk and ice cream, seems to worsen acne for some people. However, cheese, as well as nonmilk dairy products, don’t seem to worsen acne.\n\n* Fat and fatty acids.Omega-3andomega-6 fatty acidsmay help reduce acne breakouts.\n\n* Vegan and vegetarian diets.While vegan and vegetarian diets can offer plenty of health benefits, little evidence supports them specifically for the treatment of acne.\n\n* Probiotics.Whileprobiotics— found in yogurt, other fermented foods, and supplements — could help improve acne, experts have yet to find conclusive support for probiotics as an acne treatment.",
        "## Getting a diagnosis\n\nIf you suspect you have acne, a good next step involves getting a diagnosis from a board-certified dermatologist.\n\nLearn how dermatologists can help identify and treat skin conditions.\n\nA dermatologist can make a diagnosis by examining your skin.

        "### Severe\n\nFor severe acne, a dermatologist may recommend treatment that combines one or more of the following:\n\n* oral antibiotics\n\n* benzoyl peroxide\n\n* topical antibiotics\n\n* topical retinoids\n\nThey may also suggest hormonal birth control or oral isotretinoin, also known by the brand nameAccutane.\n\nAccutane is a vitamin-A medication used to treat certain cases of severenodular acne.

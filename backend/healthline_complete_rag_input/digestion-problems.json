        "# Understanding Digestion Problems\n\nWhat are digestion problems?\n\nThedigestive systemis an intricate and extensive part of the body. It ranges all the way from the mouth to the rectum. The digestive system helps your body absorb essential nutrients and is responsible for getting rid of waste.\n\nDigestion problems can mean more than unwanted symptoms. Minor problems that are left untreated can lead to more serious, chronic illnesses.\n\nBecause there are so many different types of digestion problems, you might mistakenly dismiss them. It’s important to understand common digestion problems — as well as emergency symptoms — so you know when to talk to a doctor.",
        "## Chronic constipation\n\nChronic constipationindicates a problem with getting rid of waste. This most often occurs when the colon can’t pass or move stools through the rest of the digestive tract. You may experience abdominal pain and bloating as well as fewer bowel movements (which are more painful than usual).\n\nChronic constipation is one of the most common digestive problems in the United States.Getting enough fiber, water, and exercise will likely help curb constipation. Medications can also provide relief in more serious cases.",
        "## Food intolerance\n\nFood intoleranceoccurs when your digestive system can’t tolerate certain foods. Unlike food allergies, which can cause hives and respiratory problems, an intolerance only affects digestion.\n\nSymptoms of food intolerance include:\n\n* bloatingand/or cramps\n\n* diarrhea\n\n* headache\n\n* heartburn\n\n* irritability\n\n* gas\n\n* vomiting\n\nFood intolerance is usually diagnosed by keeping and reviewing a food diary. Recording what you eat and when can help you identify which foods are triggering your symptoms.\n\nCeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder, is one type of food intolerance. It causes digestive problems when you eat gluten (a protein in wheat, barley, and rye). People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to minimize symptoms and damage to the small intestine.",
        "## GERD\n\nHeartburnis an occasional occurrence for many adults. This happens when stomach acids go back up into the esophagus, causing chest pain and the trademark burning sensation.\n\nIf you have more frequent heartburn, you might havegastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Such frequent episodes can interfere with your daily life and damage your esophagus.\n\nSymptoms of GERD include:\n\n* chest discomfort\n\n* dry cough\n\n* sour taste in the mouth\n\n* sore throat\n\n* swallowing difficulties\n\nYou may need medications to control heartburn. A damaged esophagus can make swallowing difficult and disrupt the rest of the digestive system.",
        "## Inflammatory bowel disease\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)is a type of chronic swelling. It affects one of more parts of the digestive tract.\n\nThere are two types of IBD:\n\n* Crohn’s disease: affects the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract but most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon\n\n* ulcerative colitis: affects only the colon\n\nIBD can cause more general digestive ailments, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms can include:\n\n* fatigue\n\n* incomplete bowel movements\n\n* loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss\n\n* night sweats\n\n* rectal bleeding\n\nIt’s important to diagnosis and treat IBD as soon as possible. Not only will you be more comfortable, but early treatment also reduces damage to the GI tract.",
        "## Possible serious conditions\n\nA gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases involving the digestive system. If you continue to experience digestion problems, it’s time to make an appointment.\n\nSome signs are more serious and could mean there’s an emergency medical problem. These signs include:\n\n* bloody stools\n\n* continuous vomiting\n\n* severe abdominal cramps\n\n* sweating\n\n* sudden, unintentional weight loss\n\nThese symptoms could be an indication of an infection,gallstones,hepatitis,internal bleeding, or cancer.",
        "## The outlook\n\nYou may be able to overcome digestion problems with treatment and lifestyle changes. Certain diseases of the digestive system might be long-term, but medications can help alleviate symptoms.\n\nIdentifying specific digestion problems and talking with a gastroenterologist can go a long way in terms of helping your doctor give you a proper diagnosis. Remember, you don’t have to put up with constant digestive issues.",

        "# Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid): Everything You Need to Know\n\nHypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones, often causing symptoms like weight gain and fatigue. Medications and certain lifestyle changes may help ease symptoms.",
        "## What is hypothyroidism?\n\nHypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Thethyroidis a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits in front of your windpipe. It releases hormones that help your body regulate and use energy.\n\nThyroid hormones help control functions includinghow your heart beatsandhow your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body’s natural functions begin to slow down.\n\nAlso called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism usually affects people over the age of 60 and is more common in women than men. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin.\n\nSubclinical hypothyroidismis the name given to an early, mild form of the condition.\n\nIf you’ve recently received a hypothyroidism diagnosis, it’s important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective.\n\nMost treatments rely on supplementing your low hormone levels with artificial hormones. These hormones will replace what your body isn’t producing on its own and help return your body’s functions to normal.",
        "### Hypothyroidism vs. hyperthyroidism\n\nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidismhave opposite effects. With hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone.\n\nThe greater amount of thyroid hormone causes some functions in your body to become faster, like your heart rate. You may also experience weight loss and difficulty sleeping.\n\nHyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism. It affects around1 percentof people ages 12 and older in the United States. Like hypothyroidism, it occurs more frequently in women and people over age 60.\n\nMedications, radioiodine therapy, and surgery may be used to treat hyperthyroidism.",
        "## How common is hypothyroidism?\n\nHypothyroidism is a fairly common condition. In the United States, almost5 percentof people ages 12 years old and up have hypothyroidism.\n\nThe disease gets more common with age. People over 60 years old experience it more frequently.\n\nWomen are more likely to have an underactive thyroid. In fact,1 in 8 womenwill develop thyroid issues.",
        "## What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?\n\nTheeffects of hypothyroidismon the body often vary among different people and may be difficult to identify. The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when.\n\nEarly symptoms can includeweight gainandfatigue. Note that these both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid’s health.\n\nAs a result, you may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. For instance, these may include skin changes associated with hypothyroidism, like scaly, rough, and dry skin and fragile nails.\n\nIn general, the most common signs andsymptoms of hypothyroidisminclude:\n\n* fatigue\n\n* weight gain\n\n* depression\n\n* constipation\n\n* feeling cold\n\n* decreased sweating\n\n* slowed heart rate\n\n* elevated blood cholesterol\n\n* dry skin\n\n* dry,thinninghair\n\n* impaired memory\n\n* muscle weakness\n\n* musclestiffness,aches, and tenderness\n\n* painandstiffnessin your joints\n\nFor most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general.\n\nIf you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine whether you have hypothyroidism.\n\nIf you don’t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool.",
        "### Hypothyroidism symptoms in adults\n\nBesides the most common hypothyroidism symptoms,researchindicates that hypothyroidism symptoms in men may also include erectile dysfunction.\n\nHypothyroidism symptoms in women may additionally include:\n\n* fertility difficulties\n\n* menstrual changes, particularly irregular or heavy periods\n\n* problems during pregnancy, including anemia\n\nIt’s also possible to develophypothyroidism during pregnancy. Symptoms will usually be similar to those of other cases of hypothyroidism.",
        "### Hypothyroidism in young people\n\nWhile hypothyroidism is less common in younger people, it can still occur. The condition may cause slower development inchildrenandearly pubertyin teenagers.\n\nBabies may also be born lacking thyroid function, a condition calledcongenital hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants may include:\n\n* sleeping more than usual\n\n* constipation\n\n* difficulty with feeding\n\n* delayed growth (if the condition is untreated)\n\nIn some cases, babies with hypothyroidism may show no symptoms.",
        "### Severe hypothyroidism symptoms\n\nIf hypothyroidism isn’t treated, you may develop additional symptoms:\n\n* puffy, sensitive face\n\n* hoarseness\n\n* anemia\n\n* loss of hearing\n\nIn rare cases, severe hypothyroidism may result inmyxedema coma, a life threatening condition that requires emergency care. While the condition does not actually involve being in a coma, you may experience:\n\n* fatigue\n\n* hypothermia\n\n* low blood pressure\n\n* low heart rate",
        "## What causes hypothyroidism?\n\nThe most common causes of hypothyroidism are:\n\n* Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\n\n* radioactive iodine treatment\n\n* thyroid surgery\n\n* radiation therapy\n\n* medications\n\n* iodine deficiency\n\nLess common causes include:\n\n* pituitary disorders\n\n* congenital disease\n\n* pregnancy\n\n* de Quervain thyroiditis",
        "### Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\n\nYour immune system is designed to protect your body’s cells against invadingbacteria and viruses. When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells.\n\nSometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn’t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can causeserious medical issues, including conditions such as hypothyroidism.\n\nHashimoto’s thyroiditisis an autoimmune condition and themost common causeof an underactive thyroid in the United States. This disease attacks your thyroid gland, causing damage that reduces thyroid function.\n\nIt most often affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has received a diagnosis of this disease, then your risk of having it is higher.",
        "### Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism\n\nIf your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known ashyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and regulate thyroid hormone production.\n\nStandard treatment for hyperthyroidism usesradioactive iodineto destroy thyroid cells. This may cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently.",
        "### Surgical removal of your thyroid\n\nIfyour entire thyroid gland is removedas a result of thyroid problems, you’ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication long term is the primary treatment.\n\nIf only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you may need.",
        "### Radiation therapy\n\nIf you’ve received a diagnosis of cancer of the head or neck,lymphoma, orleukemia, you may have undergoneradiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone, leading to hypothyroidism.",
        "### Medications\n\nSeveral medications may lower thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat mental health conditions, cancer, orheart disease, such as:\n\n* lithium, which treats mania in bipolar disorder\n\n* interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunotherapy drug\n\n* anti-CTLA-4 medications, which treat melanoma\n\n* amiodarone(Pacerone), anantiarrhythmic drug\n\n* stavudine, a medication forHIV",
        "### Iodine deficiency\n\nIodine deficiencyoccurs infrequently in the United States, but it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in other parts of the world.Iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormone, is found infoodsincluding:\n\n* iodized salt\n\n* dairy\n\n* seafood\n\n* eggs\n\nIf you have iodine deficiency, you may develop swelling at the base of your neck. This is called agoiter. It’s caused by an enlarged thyroid gland.",
        "### Pituitary disorders\n\nHypothyroidism may also result from problems involving thepituitary gland. This small gland in the brain produces hormones that affect many bodily functions, including the thyroid gland.\n\nProblems with the pituitary gland may cause thyroid issues. Pituitary disorders may result from:\n\n* pituitary tumors\n\n* medications like dopamine and opioids\n\n* radiation therapy around the brain\n\n* Sheehan syndrome, which damages the pituitary gland\n\nThis type of hypothyroidism is called secondary hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland functions normally. It’s less common thanprimary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland.",
        "### Congenital disease\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism that’s present in children from birth. It affects between1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 newbornsand is twice as common in females.\n\nThe condition occurs when the thyroid gland develops abnormally or is not present at all. Genetics or iodine deficiency may cause this. While some babies may show no symptoms, others will be less active or have trouble feeding.\n\nU.S. hospitals test newborns for the condition. It’s important to treat congenital hypothyroidism to prevent it from delaying growth or mental development.",
        "### Pregnancy\n\nAround5to10 percentof pregnant people will develop postpartum thyroiditis several months after their pregnancy. While only some will need treatment, others will develop permanent hypothyroidism.\n\nThe following can increase the risk of postpartum thyroiditis:\n\n* history of postpartum thyroiditis\n\n* presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in the blood\n\n* type 1 diabetes",
        "### De Quervain thyroiditis\n\nAn upperrespiratory infectionthat damages thyroid cells may cause De Quervain thyroiditis, an uncommon condition that is also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It’s most common in women and often occurs during thesummer and fall.\n\nSymptoms of de Quervain thyroiditis include:\n\n* pain in the neck, jaw, and throat\n\n* enlarged, tender thyroid gland\n\n* fever\n\n* fatigue\n\n* body pain\n\nThe condition may cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and last 2 to 8 weeks. Typically, thyroid function will then return to normal, though in some cases hypothyroidism may be permanent.",
        "## What are the risk factors of hypothyroidism?\n\nFactors that can increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism include:\n\n* being female\n\n* being at least 60 years old\n\n* being treated with radiation therapy to your neck or chest\n\n* recently being pregnant\n\n* having a family history of thyroid disorders\n\n* having certain autoimmune conditions, such asSjögren’s diseaseandtype 1 diabetes",
        "## How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?\n\nTwo primary tools are used to determine whether you have hypothyroidism: a medical evaluation and blood tests.",
        "### Medical evaluation\n\nYour doctor will complete a thoroughphysical examand medical history. They’ll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including:\n\n* dry skin\n\n* slowed reflexes\n\n* swelling in the neck\n\n* a slower heart rate\n\nIn addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you’ve been experiencing, such as fatigue, constipation, or constantly feeling cold.\n\nIf you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam.",
        "### Blood tests\n\nBlood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\n\nAthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testmeasures how much TSH yourpituitary glandis creating:\n\n* If your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. The high TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism.\n\n* If you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production.\n\nAthyroxine (T4) level testis also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests can help evaluate thyroid function.\n\nTypically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. If you have subclinical hypothyroidism, though, you may have normal T4 with a high TSH level.\n\nSince there’s aspectrum of thyroid disease, other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition.\n\nIf your T4 test is normal, you may also receive a triiodothyronine (T3) test. Low T3 levels may indicate hypothyroidism, though again, T3 levels may be normal in subclinical hypothyroidism.\n\nFinally, thyroid antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.",
        "## Which medications are available to treat hypothyroidism?\n\nHypothyroidism is a lifelong condition. For many people, medication reduces or alleviates symptoms.\n\nHypothyroidism is besttreatedby usinglevothyroxine(Levoxyl, Synthroid). This synthetic version of the T4 hormone copies the action of the thyroid hormone your body would normally produce.\n\nThe medication is designed to return adequate levels of thyroid hormone to your blood. Once hormone levels are restored, symptoms of the condition are likely to disappear or at least become much more manageable.\n\nOnce you start treatment, it will take several weeks before you’ll begin feeling relief. You’ll require follow-up blood tests to monitor your progress. You and your doctor will work together to find a dose and a treatment plan that best addresses your symptoms. This can take some time.\n\nIn most cases, people with hypothyroidism must remain on this medication their entire lives. However, the amount you take may need to be adjusted, especially if you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. To make sure your medication is still working properly, your doctor will likely test your TSH levels yearly.\n\nIf blood levels indicate the medication isn’t working as well as it should, your doctor will adjust the dose until a balance is achieved.",
        "## What alternative treatments may help hypothyroidism?\n\nBesides standard thyroid medications,animal extracts that contain thyroid hormoneare also available. These extracts come from the thyroid glands of pigs. They contain both T4 andtriiodothyronine (T3).\n\nIf you take levothyroxine, you’re only receiving T4. However, that’s all you need because your body is capable of producing T3 from the synthetic T4.\n\nResearchhas found medications with animal extracts to be similar to levothyroxine. Otherstudieshave indicated that taking animal thyroid extract may reduce thyroid symptoms but cause more side effects. Currently, animal thyroid extracts aren’t routinely recommended.\n\nYou can also buy glandular extract supplements in some health food stores. Additionally,studiessuggest thatselenium supplementsmay help people with hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune disease, though research is mixed.\n\nNote that dietary supplements aren’t regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of this, their potency, legitimacy, and purity aren’t guaranteed.\n\nUse these products at your own risk. It’s important to tell your doctor if you decide to try a supplement so they can adjust your treatment accordingly.",
        "## What are the complications of hypothyroidism?\n\nComplications of hypothyroidisminclude:\n\n* heart problems\n\n* goiter\n\n* nerve injury\n\n* peripheral neuropathy\n\n* carpal tunnel syndrome\n\n* reduced kidney function\n\n* myxedema coma, in cases of severe disease\n\n* obstructive sleep apnea\n\n* mental health issues, like anxiety and depression\n\n* joint pain\n\n* balance issues\n\n* obesity, though thelinkis still being studied, and moderate weight gain is most likely\n\n* high cholesterol\n\n* infertility\n\n* preeclampsia and anemia during pregnancy\n\n* birth defects",
        "## Are there special dietary recommendations for people with hypothyroidism?\n\nAs a general rule, you don’t need to follow a specificdiet for hypothyroidism. However, there are some recommendations to keep in mind.",
        "### Eat a balanced diet\n\nYour thyroid needs adequate amounts of iodine to fully function, but you don’t need to take an iodine supplement to achieve that.\n\nThere are plenty ofiodine-rich foods, including:\n\n* iodized salt\n\n* dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese\n\n* eggs\n\n* seafood\n\n* seaweed\n\nIn general, a balanced diet should provide enough iodine for most people.",
        "### Monitor your soy intake\n\nSoymay be linked to hypothyroidism. Drinking or eating too many soy products may lower thyroid function, especially in people with thyroid disorders. However, more research in this area is needed.\n\nSoy is found in:\n\n* tofu\n\n* vegan cheese and meat products\n\n* soy milk\n\n* soybeans\n\n* soy sauce\n\nIt’s especially important for caregivers to monitor the soy intake of infants who need hypothyroidism treatment and also drink soy formula.",
        "### Be smart with fiber\n\nFibermay interfere with thyroid hormone absorption. Too much dietary fiber may prevent your body from getting the hormones it needs from thyroid medications.\n\nFiber is vital, so don’t skip it entirely. Instead, avoid taking your medication within several hours of eatinghigh fiber foods.",
        "### Avoid taking thyroid medication with other supplements\n\nIf you take supplements or medications in addition to thyroid medications, try to take them at different times. Other medications caninterfere withabsorption, so it’s best to take your thyroid medication without other supplements, medications, or foods.",
        "## What are some tips for coping with hypothyroidism?\n\nEven if you’re undergoing treatment, you may deal with long lasting issues or complications from hypothyroidism. However, there are ways to lessen the condition’s effect on your quality of life.",
        "### Monitor for other health conditions\n\nThere’s a link between other autoimmune diseases and hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism often goes along with conditions such as:\n\n* celiac disease\n\n* diabetes\n\n* rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\n* lupus\n\n* disorders affecting theadrenal gland\n\n* pituitary problems",
        "### Develop fatigue coping strategies\n\nDespite taking medication, you may still experience fatigue from time to time. To help you manage low energy levels, it’s important that you:\n\n* get quality sleep each night\n\n* eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables\n\n* consider the use of stress-relieving mechanisms, such asmeditationandyoga\n\nA2018 studyfound that yoga improved fatigue and other symptoms in a small group of people with hypothyroidism, though more research is needed.",
        "### Talk it out\n\nHaving achronic health conditioncan be difficult, especially if it’s accompanied by other health concerns. Since hypothyroidism can cause depression and fatigue, it may also make yourrelationships more challenging.\n\nFind people with whom you can openly express your feelings and experiences. This might be a:\n\n* mental health counselor\n\n* close friend\n\n* family member\n\n* support group of other people living with the condition\n\nSome hospitals sponsor meetings for people with health conditions including hypothyroidism. Ask for a recommendation from your doctor and consider attending a meeting.\n\nResearchindicates that online communities may also help strengthen social connections, provide a supportive space, and help people with chronic illnesses share advice.\n\nSupport groups can help you connect withpeople who understandexactly what you’re experiencing while offering a guiding hand.",
        "## What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and depression?\n\nWhen levels of thyroid hormones are low, your body’s natural functions lag. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and evendepression.\n\nA small 2016 study found that60 percentof participants with hypothyroidism exhibited some symptoms of depression.\n\nHypothyroidism may cause a range of mental health difficulties. This can make diagnosing hypothyroidism difficult. Before making a treatment plan for mental health issues, doctors may consider testing for an underactive thyroid.\n\nDepression and hypothyroidismcan share several symptoms. These include:\n\n* fatigue\n\n* weight gain\n\n* depressed mood\n\n* reduced desire and satisfaction\n\n* difficulty concentrating\n\nThe two conditions also have symptoms that may distinguish them from one another. For hypothyroidism, problems such as dry skin, constipation, and hair loss are common. For depression alone, these conditions wouldn’t be expected.\n\nDepression is often a diagnosis made based on symptoms and medical history. Low thyroid function is diagnosed with a physical exam and blood tests. To see whether there’s a link between your depression and your thyroid function, your doctor can order these tests for a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIf your depression is caused only by hypothyroidism, correcting the thyroid disorder should treat the depression. If it doesn’t, your doctor may prescribe medications for both conditions. They’ll slowly adjust your doses until your depression and hypothyroidism are better managed.",
        "## What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and anxiety?\n\nWhile hypothyroidism has long been associated with depression, a2016 studysuggested it may be associated withanxietytoo.\n\nResearchers evaluated 100 people between the ages of 18 and 45 who had a known history of hypothyroidism. Using an anxiety questionnaire, they found that around 63 percent of them met the criteria for some form of anxiety.\n\nLarger and more focused studies on anxiety may help determine whether a true connection exists between hypothyroidism and anxiety.\n\nIt’s important for you and your doctor to discuss all your symptoms when being evaluated for thyroid or mental health conditions.",
        "## What’s the effect of hypothyroidism on pregnancy?\n\nPeople with thyroid problems can and very often do have healthy pregnancies. Still, hypothyroidism can pose a particular set of challenges for pregnancy.\n\nLow thyroid function or unmanagedhypothyroidism during pregnancycan cause:\n\n* anemia\n\n* miscarriage\n\n* preeclampsia\n\n* stillbirth\n\n* low birth weight\n\n* brain development problems\n\n* birth defects\n\nIf you have hypothyroidism and are pregnant, it’s important to take the following steps during the time you’re expecting:",
        "### Talk with your doctor about testing\n\nYou can develop hypothyroidism while pregnant. Some doctors routinely check thyroid levels during pregnancy to monitor for low thyroid hormone levels. If your levels are lower than they should be, your doctor may suggest treatment.\n\nSome people who never had thyroid problems before they were pregnant may develop them after having a baby. This is calledpostpartum thyroiditis.\n\nIn many cases, the condition resolves within12 to 18 months, and medication is no longer required. However, around 20 percent of people with postpartum thyroiditis will need long-term therapy.",
        "### Stay up to date with your medication\n\nContinue to take your medication as prescribed. It’s common to have regular testing so your doctor can make any necessary adjustments to your thyroid medication as your pregnancy progresses. This ensures that the baby is getting enough thyroid hormone for their brain and nervous system to develop normally.",
        "### Eat well\n\nYour body needs more nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while you’re pregnant. Eating abalanced dietandtaking multivitamins while pregnantcan help you maintain a healthy pregnancy.\n\nIt’s also important to get enough iodine, which is essential for producing thyroid hormone. Aim to consume around250 microgramsof iodine each day through food or supplements. Remember to talk with your doctor before starting any new supplements.",
        "## What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight gain?\n\nYour thyroid is responsible for many of your body’s daily functions, including metabolism, organ function, andtemperature control. When your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone, all of these functions can slow down.\n\nIf your thyroid gland doesn’t function properly, yourbasal metabolic rate— a measurement of the amount of energy your body uses at rest — may be low. As a result, an underactive thyroid may lead to some weight gain. The more severe the condition is, the greater your weight gain is likely to be.\n\nThe typical amount of weight gain isn’t very high, though. Most people will gain somewhere between5 and 10 pounds.\n\nProperly treating the condition may lead you to lose any weight you gained while your thyroid levels were not treated. However, keep in mind that that’s not always the case. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid, including weight gain, often develop over a long period of time and may not be caused by a thyroid disorder alone.\n\nIf your weight stays the same, it doesn’t mean the condition isn’t being properly treated. Instead, it may indicate that your weight gain was the result of lifestyle or other conditions rather than low hormone levels.",
        "## What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight loss?\n\nOnce you’re treated for hypothyroidism, you may lose any weight you gained from low hormone levels. That’s because once your thyroid levels are restored, your ability tomanage your weightreturns to normal.\n\nIf you’re treating hypothyroidism but don’t see a change in your weight, you may still be able to lose weight if that’s a goal for you. Work with a doctor,registered dietitian, or personal trainer to develop a healthy eating plan andexercise strategyto reach or maintain a moderate weight.",
        "### Can anemia be mistaken for hypothyroidism?\n\nHypothyroidism and anemia may havesimilar symptoms, such as fatigue. A doctor will run several tests to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.",
        "### Can hypothyroidism cause anemia?\n\nIf left untreated, hypothyroidism may lead to anemia due to malabsorption of iron.",
        "### Is anemia a symptom of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis?\n\nAccording to a2017 review, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis may impact how your body absorbs certain nutrients. This may include iron. Over time, this may lead to anemia.",
        "### What type of anemia does hypothyroidism cause?\n\nThe authors of a2017 reviewsuggest that hypothyroidism may be linked withseveral types of anemia, such as normochromic normocytic, hypochromic microcytic, and megaloblastic types.",
        "## The takeaway\n\nYour body naturally goes through changesas you get older. If you notice a significant difference in how you feel or how your body is responding, talk with your doctor to see whether a thyroid problem may be affecting you. If you’re a woman over age 60, remember that you’re at higher risk of a thyroid disorder.\n\nIf you have hypothyroidism, you’ll probably need to take thyroid medications for the rest of your life. Still, it’s likely that medication will help relieve or resolve your symptoms. You may also benefit from joining a support group for people living with hypothyroidism.",

        "## Who experiences back pain?\n\nLower back pain, sometimes called lumbago, is not a specific disease diagnosis. It’s a symptom of several different types of medical problems.\n\nIt usually results from a problem with one or more parts of the lower back, such as:\n\n* ligaments and muscles\n\n* discs\n\n* intervertebral discs\n\n* nerves\n\n* the bony structures that make up the spine, called vertebral bodies or vertebrae\n\nIt can also be due to a problem with nearby organs, such as thekidneys.\n\nAccording to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons,75 to 85 percentof Americans will experience back pain in their lifetime. Of those, 50 percent will have more than one episode within a year.\n\nIn 90 percent of all cases, the pain gets better without surgery. Talk with a doctor if you’re experiencing back pain.",

        "### Medication\n\nThe majority of back pain episodesare relievedby treatment withnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as:\n\n* ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\n\n* naproxen (Aleve)\n\nAnalgesics, such asacetaminophen (Tylenol), are another category of pain relievers. They are also an option for back pain, though they don’t have the anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nBe careful with medications likeibuprofenif you have kidney problems orstomach ulcers.\n\nNever take more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter medications without a doctor’s recommendation, as even these medications may have severe side effects if taken incorrectly.\n\nOther medication optionsinclude:\n\nTopical products may be highly effective at reducing back pain.

These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce pain.\n\nAntidepressantsand other medications can sometimes be usedoff-labelfor the treatment of back pain.\n\nIf your back pain is severe, your doctor may prescribeamitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, because it focuses on different parts of the pain response. This antidepressant may also work better for nerve-related pain.\n\nYour doctor might alsorecommendcortisone steroid injections for certain causes of back pain. For example, a person with back pain that involves a nerve may get a cortisone steroid injection.\n\nOpioids are stronger pain medications that can be prescribed for more severe pain. These medications, such asoxycodone (OxyContin)and a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone (Vicodin), act on the brain cells and body to reduce pain.\n\nOpioids should be used with caution, however, due to a risk ofaddiction.",
        "### Surgery\n\nSurgery is usually reserved for those with structural abnormalities that haven’t responded to nonsurgical treatment with medication and therapy.\n\nSurgery may be an option for people with:\n\n* severe, constant pain with identifiable structural abnormalities\n\n* nerve compressionthat causes muscles to become weak\n\n* spinal cord compression that limits daily activities",

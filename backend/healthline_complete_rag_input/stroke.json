        "# Everything You Need to Know About Stroke\n\nA stroke is a disruption of blood flow to a part of your brain. Symptoms can come on quickly and without warning. Recognizing stroke symptoms and seeking treatment quickly can lead to a better outcome.\n\nA stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues.\n\nAccording to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke.\n\nWithout oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes. It’s important to be able to recognize the symptoms of a stroke and to seek a speedy diagnosis and treatment.",
        "## What are the symptoms of a stroke?\n\nThe loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain.Symptoms of a strokeshow up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain.\n\nThe sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it’s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms caninclude:\n\n* paralysis\n\n* numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body (hemiparesis)\n\n* trouble speaking or understanding others\n\n* slurred speech\n\n* confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness\n\n* sudden behavioral changes, especially increased agitation\n\n* vision problems, such as trouble seeing in one or both eyes with vision blackened or blurred, or double vision\n\n* trouble walking\n\n* loss of balance or coordination\n\n* dizziness\n\n* severe, sudden headachewith an unknown cause\n\n* seizures\n\n* nausea or vomiting\n\nRecognizing the symptoms of a stroke in someone can play an important role in improving their outcome. Experts recommend youBE-FAST:\n\n* Balance:Are they having trouble with balance or coordination?\n\n* Eyes:Are they experiencing visual symptoms, like double vision or blurry vision?\n\n* Face:Does one side of their face droop if they try to smile?\n\n* Arms:Can they lift both arms or is one arm weak or numb?\n\n* Speech:Is their speech slurred or difficult to understand?\n\n* Time:If any of the above symptoms are present, time to call 911 or your local emergency services.\n\nPrompt treatment is key to preventing brain damage, long-term disability, or death. It’s better to be overly cautious when dealing with a stroke, so don’t be afraid to get emergency medical help if you think yourecognize the signs of a stroke.",
        "## What causes a stroke?\n\nThecause of a strokedepends on the type of stroke. Strokes fall intothree main categories:\n\n* ischemic stroke\n\n* hemorrhagic stroke\n\n* transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n\nThe type of stroke you have affects your treatment and recovery process.",
        "### Ischemic stroke\n\nDuring anischemic stroke, the arteries supplying blood to the brain narrow or become blocked. Blood clots or severely reduced blood flow to the brain cause these blockages. Pieces of plaque breaking off and blocking a blood vessel can also cause them.\n\nTwo types of blockagescan lead to ischemic stroke:\n\n* A cerebral embolism (embolic stroke) occurs when a blood clot forms in another part of the body — often the heart or arteries in the upper chest and neck — and moves through the bloodstream until it hits an artery too narrow to let it pass. The clot gets stuck, stops the flow of blood, and causes a stroke.\n\n* Cerebral thrombosis (thrombotic stroke) occurs when a blood clot develops at the fatty plaque within the blood vessel.\n\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI),87%of strokes are ischemic.",
        "### Hemorrhagic stroke\n\nAhemorrhagic strokehappens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues.\n\nDoctors categorize hemorrhagic strokes into two primary types:\n\n* Anintracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) strokeis the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It happens when the tissues surrounding the brain fill with blood after an artery bursts.\n\n* Asubarachnoid hemorrhagic (SAH) strokeis less common. It causes bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it.\n\nTheNHLBIstates that 10% of strokes are ICH, while 3% are SAH.",
        "### Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n\nATIA, or ministroke, occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily. Symptoms are similar to those of a full stroke. However, they typically disappear after a few minutes or hours when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored.\n\nA blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it’s not technically a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it’s best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for amajor strokeand get emergency medical help.\n\nAccording to the American Stroke Association, close to1 in 5people with a TIA will have a full stroke within 3 months.",
        "## What are the risk factors for stroke?\n\nCertain risk factors make you more susceptible to stroke, including:\n\n* an unbalanced diet high in salt,saturated and trans fats, and cholesterol\n\n* physical inactivity\n\n* heavyalcohol use\n\n* tobacco use\n\n* afamily historyof stroke\n\n* beingassigned female at birth\n\n* increasing age\n\n* race or ethnicity, such as beingAfrican American, Alaska Native, or American Indian\n\nCertain medical conditions can also increase your risk of stroke, including:\n\n* a previous stroke or TIA\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* high cholesterol\n\n* diabetes\n\n* carrying too much excess weight\n\n* heart disorders, such ascoronary artery disease\n\n* heart valve defects\n\n* enlarged heart chambers andirregular heartbeats\n\n* sickle cell disease\n\n* diabetes\n\n* blood clotting disorder\n\n* patent foramen ovale",
        "## What are the complications of stroke?\n\nThe complications after a stroke can vary, depending on which parts of the brain have experienced severe damage.\n\nSome of these complications include:\n\n* seizures\n\n* loss of bladder and bowel control\n\n* problems with speech and swallowing\n\n* cognitive impairment, includingdementia\n\n* reduced mobility, range of motion, or ability to control certain muscle movements\n\n* depression\n\n* mood, emotional, orbehavioral changes\n\n* shoulder pain\n\n* bed sores\n\n* sensory or sensation changes\n\nWhile you may be able to overcome some complications after time, some may be permanent.",
        "## How to prevent a stroke\n\nThe NHLBI estimates that82% to 90%of strokes are preventable. While lifestyle changes can’t prevent all strokes, many of these changes can make a significant difference in lowering your risk.\n\nExperts recommend you consider the following:\n\n* Quit smoking:If you smoke,quittingnow will lower your risk of stroke. You can reach out to a doctor to create a quit plan.\n\n* Limit alcohol use:Heavy alcohol consumption canraise your blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of stroke. If reducing your intake is difficult, contact a doctor for help.\n\n* Keep a moderate weight:Overweight and obesity increase the risk of stroke. To help manage your weight, eat abalanced dietand stay physically active. Both steps can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\n* Get regular checkups:Talk with a doctor about how often to get a checkup for blood pressure, cholesterol, and any conditions you may have. They can also support you in making these lifestyle changes and offer guidance.",
        "## How do doctors diagnose stroke?\n\nTodiagnose stroke, a doctor will first ask you or a family member about your symptoms and what you were doing when they arose. They’ll take your medical history to find out your stroke risk factors. They’ll also:\n\n* ask what medications you take\n\n* check your blood pressure\n\n* listen to your heart\n\nYou’ll also have a physical exam, during which your doctor will evaluate you for:\n\n* balance\n\n* coordination\n\n* weakness\n\n* numbness in your arms, face, or legs\n\n* signs of confusion\n\n* vision issues\n\nYour doctor will then do certain imaging and blood tests to help confirm a stroke diagnosis. These tests can help them determine whether you had a stroke and, if so:\n\n* what may have caused it\n\n* what part of the brain is affected\n\n* whether you have bleeding in the brain",
        "## What is the treatment for stroke?\n\nProper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. Treatment will depend on the type of stroke.",
        "### Ischemic stroke and TIA\n\nSince a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, doctors essentially treat them with similar techniques. They caninclude:\n\n* thrombolytic drugs, namely tissue plasminogen activator (tPA or Atlepase), to break up blood clots in your brain’s arteries within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms\n\n* mechanical thrombectomyto remove the blood clot within 24 hours of symptom onset\n\n* stentsto support weakened artery walls\n\n* surgery to remove plaquefrom your arteries\n\n* aspirin or other blood thinners to prevent further blood clots",
        "### Hemorrhagic stroke\n\nStrokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic strokeinclude:\n\n* medications to reduce blood pressure, prevent seizures, and prevent blood vessel constriction\n\n* surgery to repair the brain aneurysm, usually by processes called coiling orclipping\n\n* craniotomyto relieve pressure on the brain\n\nIn addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes.",
        "## Stroke medications\n\nDoctors use various medications both to treat stroke and prevent future strokes. The type of medication your doctor prescribes depends largely on the type of stroke you had.\n\nCommon stroke medicationsinclude:\n\n* tPA, injected into a blood vessel to break up blood clots during a stroke\n\n* anticoagulantslike warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to prevent blood clots or stop existing clots from getting larger\n\n* direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a newer drug class of anticoagulants that work faster and require less monitoring\n\n* antiplateletslike aspirin andclopidogrel(Plavix) to make it more difficult for your blood to clot\n\n* statinsto lower high blood cholesterol levels and reduce plaque buildup on artery walls that could lead to a clot\n\n* blood pressure medications, as high blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke",
        "## What can I expect during recovery from a stroke?\n\nStroke is aleading cause of disabilityin the United States. While some people will fully recover, many will have long-term disabilities.\n\nIt’s important that recovery and rehabilitation from a stroke start as soon as possible. In fact, stroke recovery should begin in the hospital.\n\nIn a hospital, a care team can stabilize your condition and assess the effects of the stroke. They can identify underlying factors and begin therapy to help you regain some of your affected skills.\n\nStroke recovery typically focuses on four main areas:\n\n* speech therapyto relearn how to speak and help with swallowing difficulties\n\n* cognitive therapyto regain former patterns of thinking and behavior\n\n* relearning sensory skills, such as temperature, pressure, and pain, often with the help of anoccupational therapist\n\n* physical therapyto regain strength and balance and adjust to any limitations",
        "## Takeaway\n\nIf you suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of a stroke, it’s vital you seek emergency medical treatment as soon as possible.\n\nHealthcare professionals can only provide clot-busting medication in the first few hours after the signs of a stroke begin. Early treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of long-term complications and disability.\n\nWhile it’s not always possible to completely prevent a stroke, certain lifestyle changes can significantly reduce your risk. Medications can also help reduce the risk of blood clots, which can lead to stroke.\n\nIf your doctor believes you might be at risk of stroke, they will work with you to find a prevention strategy that works for you, including medical intervention and lifestyle changes.",

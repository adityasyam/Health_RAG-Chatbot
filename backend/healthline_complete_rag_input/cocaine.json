        "# Everything You Need to Know About Cocaine\n\nCocaine — aka coke, blow, and snow — is a powerful stimulant made from the leaves of the coca plant. It usually comes in the form of a white, crystalline powder.\n\nWhile it has a few medicinal uses, personal use is illegal in the United States.\n\nIf you use it, are considering using it, or are around anyone who does, read on. We’ll cover everything you need to know, like what to expect from the high, potential risks, and what to do if things go south.\n\nHealthline does not endorse the use of any illegal substances, and we recognize abstaining from them is always the safest approach. However, we believe in providing accessible and accurate information to reduce the harm that can occur when using.",
        "## How is it used?\n\nCocaine is often snorted, but people also:\n\n* dissolve the powder and inject it\n\n* ingest it orally\n\n* sprinkle it on cigarettes or joints to smoke it\n\n* rub it on their gums (gumming)\n\nSome people process cocaine into a rock and smoke it, which we’ll get to next.",
        "## Is it the same thing as crack?\n\nCrack is cocainefreebasethat’s been processed into a rock. This makes for a more potent, smokable substance.\n\nCocaine is made from hydrochloride and alkaloid, which is also known as base. Baking soda or ammonium is used to “free” the base by removing the hydrochloride.\n\nThe end result is crack. It got its name from the crackling sound from heating and smoking the rock.",
        "## What does it feel like?\n\nPeople use coke for its intense psychologicaleffects, like euphoria and boosted confidence. But it can also produce some not-so-pleasant psychological and physical effects.",
        "### Psychological effects\n\nCommon psychological effects of cocaine include:\n\n* feelings of intense happiness\n\n* increased energy\n\n* paranoia\n\n* feeling more social and talkative\n\n* inflated confidence\n\n* increased alertness\n\n* irritability\n\n* anxiety",
        "### Physical effects\n\nCocaine produces several physical effects, including:\n\n* dilated pupils\n\n* fast or irregular heartbeat\n\n* constricted blood vessels\n\n* muscle twitches\n\n* tremors\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* increased body temperature\n\n* nausea\n\n* restlessness\n\n* decreased appetite\n\n* insomnia\n\n* headache\n\n* dizziness\n\n* diarrhea\n\n* bloody nose\n\n* trouble getting or keeping an erection",
        "## How long do the effects take to kick in?\n\nCoke’s effects kick in fast, but the exact onset depends on how you consume it.\n\nHere’s thebreakdown:\n\n* Snorting:1 to 3 minutes\n\n* Gumming:1 to 3 minutes\n\n* Smoking:10 to 15 seconds\n\n* Injecting:10 to 15 seconds\n\nThe reason for the time difference comes from the speed at which it enters your bloodstream.\n\nWhen snorted or gummed, coke needs to get through mucus, skin, and other tissues. It bypasses all that when you inject or smoke it, allowing it to enter the bloodstream almost immediately.",
        "## How long do the effects last?\n\nThat also depends on how it’s consumed, along with other variables, like your dose and whether you’re taking other substances.\n\nHere’s what to expect in terms ofhow long the high lasts:\n\n* Snorting:15 to 30 minutes\n\n* Gumming:15 to 30 minutes\n\n* Smoking:5 to 15 minutes\n\n* Injecting:5 to 15 minutes\n\nOf course, everyone’s different, so things might last for more or less time for some folks.",
        "## Is there a comedown?\n\nYes. A cocaine comedown can last as long as a few days. How much you use plays a role in how hard you crash.\n\nOnce the high wears off, coke can leave you feeling depressed and extremely tired forseveral days. The short-lived high is also often followed by an intense desire to use more and difficulty sleeping.",
        "## How long does it stay in your system?\n\nCocaine typically stays in your system for 1 to 4 days but can be detected for a couple of weeks in some people.\n\nSeveral factors can affecthow long it hangs aroundin your body, including:\n\n* how much you use\n\n* how often you use it\n\n* how you use it\n\n* the coke’s purity\n\n* your body fat percentage\n\n* other substances you take\n\nHow long it’s detectable depends on the type ofdrug testused.\n\nHere are the general detection windows by test type:\n\n* Urine:up to 4 days\n\n* Blood:up to 2 days\n\n* Saliva:up to 2 days\n\n* Hair:up to 3 months",
        "## Is it safe to use with alcohol?\n\nCocaine and alcoholmake for a dangerous duo that can sometimes be life threatening.\n\nThe combo leads to the production of a metabolite called cocaethylene, which is considerably stronger than cocaine or alcohol alone.\n\nIt increases toxicity to the heart, liver, and other organs. It raises the risk of the serious effects already associated with cocaine use, including heart problems and stroke.\n\nMixing alcohol and cocaine has also beenshownto increase cravings for each substance, leading to a higher risk of dependence.",
        "## Any other potential interactions?\n\nThere are quite a few known interactions between cocaine and other substances, including over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications and other drugs.\n\nThe most serious cocaine interactions involve:\n\n* alcohol\n\n* heroin\n\n* opioids\n\n* antipsychotics\n\n* antidepressants\n\nOther potential cocaine interactions include:\n\n* anticonvulsants\n\n* caffeine\n\n* amphetamines\n\n* cannabis\n\n* psychedelics, such asLSD,DMT, andshrooms\n\n* dissociative drugs, such asketamine (special K),DXM, andPCP\n\n* MDMA (molly, ecstasy)",
        "## Is there a risk of addiction?\n\nCocaine has high addiction potential. You can develop a tolerance to it after just a few uses. This means you need more of a substance to get the same effect you once did.\n\nThe more you use it, the higher your risk for developing asubstance use disorder.\n\nThe risk of addiction is even higher with crack cocaine because its effects are more immediate and more intense.\n\nCombining cocaine with alcohol and other substances also increases the risk of addiction.\n\nSigns and symptoms of acocaine addictioninclude:\n\n* needing more of it to get high\n\n* not being able to stop or use less\n\n* withdrawal symptoms when you stop using it\n\n* continuing to use it in spite of the consequences\n\n* negative impact on your personal life, work life, or both\n\n* spending excessive time or money on cocaine\n\n* hallucinations and psychosis",
        "### Heart problems\n\nCocaine is particularly rough on the heart and cardiovascular system.\n\nUsing it can increase your risk for several heart-related issues, including:\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* inflammation of the heart muscle\n\n* aortic dissection\n\n* abnormal heart rhythms\n\n* heart attack",
        "### Nasal issues\n\nSnorting cocaine can do some serious damage to your nasal tissues.\n\nWhen you snort coke, the lining of your nasal passages become inflamed. Over time, this can lead to:\n\n* loss of smell\n\n* nosebleeds\n\n* chronic rhinitis\n\n* trouble swallowing\n\nLong-term or frequent use can break down tissue, causing sores. In severe cases, the septum (the cartilage between your nostrils) can develop a hole.",
        "### Bloodborne infections\n\nCocaine use carries a high risk of contracting bloodborne infections, including HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nInjecting it carries the highest risk of bloodborne infections, but you can also contract infections by smoking and snorting coke.\n\nAll of these methods involve the use of a device, like a needle, pipe, or straw. Sharing any of these can introduce infection into the bloodstream through your veins, or through small cuts or sores in the mucus membranes.",
        "### Skin and vein damage\n\nInjecting coke can cause skin bruising and scarring and lead to collapsed veins. Snorting can damage your mucous membranes, causing inflammation and sores in and around your nostrils.",
        "### Mental health issues\n\nLong-term cocaine use can cause auditory and tactile hallucinations, causing you to hear and feel things that aren’t there.",
        "## Safety tips\n\nIf you’re going to do cocaine, keep these tips in mind to reduce some of its risks:\n\n* Test your coke.Cocaine is often cut with other substances, some of which can be harmful and even deadly, including fentanyl. You can purchase cocaine test kits atDanceSafe.org.\n\n* Be smart about your props.Never share needles, pipes, and straws. Always inspect your devices before using. Check pipes and straws for chips or other damage. Make sure needles are sterile.\n\n* Go low and slow.Stick to a low dose and avoid redosing for as long as you can.

This position helps keep their airway open and can prevent choking in case they begin to vomit.",

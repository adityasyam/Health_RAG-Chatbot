        "# Type 1 Diabetes: Symptoms, Vs. Type 2, Causes, and More\n\n**Description**: Everything you need to know about type 1 diabetes, a chronic disease that causes high blood sugar levels because the body cannot make the hormone insulin.\n\n\nBezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions.

        "# What Is Type 1 Diabetes?\n\nType 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. In people with type 1 diabetes, cells in the pancreas that make insulin are destroyed, so the body is unable to make insulin.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that helps your body’s cells use glucose (sugar) for energy. Your body gets glucose from the food you eat. Insulin allows the glucose to pass from your blood into your body’s cells.\n\nWhen the cells have enough, your liver and muscle tissues store the extraglucosein the form of glycogen. It’s broken down into blood sugar and released when you need energy between meals, during exercise, or while you sleep.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body is unable to process glucose due to the lack ofinsulin.\n\nGlucose from your food can’t make its way into your cells. This leaves too much glucose circulating in your blood. High blood sugar levels can lead to both short- and long-term problems.",
        "## Symptoms of type 1 diabetes\n\nThe following are symptoms of type 1 diabetes:\n\n* excessive hunger\n\n* excessive thirst\n\n* blurred vision\n\n* fatigue\n\n* frequent urination\n\n* dramatic weight loss in a short period of time\n\nIf you have one or more type 1 diabetes symptoms, you should contact a healthcare professional.\n\nIf you have symptoms ofketoacidosis, you should get medical help right away. Ketoacidosis is a medical emergency.\n\nLearn more about early signs and advanced symptoms of diabetes.",
        "## Type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. They have similar symptoms and over time, they can lead to many of the same complications. However, they are very different diseases.\n\nType 1 diabetes is the result of a person’s body not producing insulin on its own. Taking insulin is necessary for survival, to move glucose from the bloodstream into the body’s cells.\n\nFor people withtype 2 diabetes, the cells have stopped responding well to insulin. The body struggles to move glucose from the blood into the cells, despite having adequate levels of the hormone. Eventually, their bodies may stop making adequate insulin entirely.\n\nType 1 diabetes develops very quickly and symptoms are obvious. For people with type 2 diabetes, the condition can develop over many years. In fact, a person with type 2 diabetes may not know they have it until they have a complication.\n\nThe two types of diabetes are caused by different things. They also have unique risk factors.\n\nRead about similarities and differences between the types of diabetes.",
        "## Causes of type 1 diabetes\n\nResearchers don’t know the exact cause of type 1 diabetes.\n\nIt is thought to be an autoimmune reaction, in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin by mistake, per theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But scientists don’t fully understand why this happens.\n\nSome people may be predisposed to develop the condition due to genetics, according to theAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA). Other people may get it due to environmental factors, such as diet. Viruses may also play a part. Sometimes a combination of these factors will trigger the condition.",
        "## Type 1 diabetes risk factors\n\nRisk factors for type 1 diabetes are poorly understood. In many ways, they are similar to causes of diabetes.\n\nThis is because the factors that may trigger type 1 diabetes for some people may not trigger it for others.\n\nResearchers have identified some potential risk factors:",
        "### Race\n\nRace may be a risk factor for type 1 diabetes. People who are white may have more genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes, since the condition is more common in this group.",
        "### Environmental factors\n\nSomevirusesmay trigger type 1 diabetes as well. It’s unclear which ones might do this, however.\n\nLikewise, people from cold climates are more likely to have type 1 diabetes. Doctors also diagnose more cases of type 1 in winter than they do in summer.\n\nSeveral other components may influence who develops type 1 diabetes.\n\nRead about these possible risk factors and the research underway to better understand why some people develop the disease.",
        "### Genetic factors\n\nResearchers don’t understand exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. However, they believe that your genes may play a role, both in terms of the genes you inherit and your family’s history of diabetes.\n\nPeople who have type 1 diabetes are born with a greater likelihood of developing the disease. It does appear to be passed down through generations of a family. It’s unclear how the pattern works and why some people in a family will develop diabetes while others will not.\n\nResearchers have identified certain gene variants that may increase a person’s risk. These variants can be shared between parent and child, generation after generation. However, not everyone who has these genes develops type 1 diabetes.\n\nThat’s why researchers believe genes are only one part of the equation. They think something triggers the condition in people who have the inherited genes. A virus is one suspected trigger.\n\nFor example,identical twins, who have all the same genes, may not both develop the condition. If one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other twin develops the conditionhalf of the timeor less. This suggests that genes aren’t the only factor.",
        "## Type 1 diabetes treatment\n\nIf you receive a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, your body can’t make its own insulin. You’ll need to take insulin to help your body use the sugar in your blood.\n\nOther treatments may also hold some promise forcontrollingsymptoms of type 1 diabetes.",
        "### Insulin\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day. You usually take the insulin through an injection.\n\nSome people use an insulin pump. The pump injects insulin through a port in the skin. This can be easier for some people than sticking themselves with a needle. It may also help level out blood sugar highs and lows.\n\nThe amount of insulin you need varies throughout the day. People with type 1 diabetes regularly test their blood sugar to figure out how much insulin they need. Both diet and exercise can affect blood sugar levels.\n\nSeveral insulin types exist. Your doctor may have you try more than one to find what works best for you.\n\nRead about the differences in insulin and how it’s administered.",
        "### Metformin\n\nMetforminis a type of oral diabetes medication. For many years, it was approved only for people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nHowever, some people with type 1 diabetes can developinsulin resistance. That means the insulin they get from injections doesn’t work as well as it should. These days, doctors sometimes prescribe Metformin for type 1 patients.\n\nMetformin helps lower sugar in the blood by reducing sugar production in the liver. Your doctor may advise you to take Metformin in addition to insulin.\n\nIn May 2020, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA)recommended that some makers of metformin extended release remove some of their tablets from the U.S. market. This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets. If you currently take this drug, call your doctor. They will advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription.",
        "### Vaccines\n\nThetuberculosis vaccinemay possibly have some benefit as a treatment for people with type 1 diabetes but the data is very limited.\n\nOne2012 studyfound that the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may have some impact on the autoimmune response that may be triggering type 1 diabetes. Since then, there’s been more research into the BCG vaccine and its potential use as a treatment tool for diabetes and other conditions.\n\nThe evidence for the vaccine’s use in diabetes remains controversial, though. A2018 studysuggests some promise, but at least one2020 studydoes not.",
        "### Other medications\n\nThere is a new oral medication for people with type 1 diabetes. This drug will be the first oral medication designed to be used alongside insulin in people with type 1 diabetes, according to a2019 research review.\n\nIt works to lower glucose levels in the blood by forcing the body to expel it in urine and by reducing glucose absorption in the gut. Similar medications already exist for people with type 2 diabetes, but none are approved for people with type 1.\n\nHowever,Sotagliflozin (Zynquista)wasdeniedby the FDA in 2019 due to some concerns about the medication as it’s currently produced.\n\nOn the other hand, the medication has beenapprovedby the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This raises the possibility that FDA may at some point still approve it in the United States.",
        "## Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes\n\nHealthcare professionals usually diagnose type 1 diabetes through a series of tests. Some can be conducted quickly, while others require hours of preparation or monitoring.\n\nType 1 diabetes often develops quickly. According to theCDC, a healthcare professional can make a diabetes diagnosis if:\n\n* Fasting blood sugar is greater than 126 mg/dL on two separate tests.\n\n* Random blood sugar is greater than 200 mg/dL, along with symptoms of diabetes.\n\n* Hemoglobin A1c is greater than 6.5 on two separate tests.\n\nDoctors also use the same criteria to diagnose type 2 diabetes. In fact, people with type 1 diabetes are sometimesmisdiagnosedas having type 2.\n\nA doctor may not realize you’ve been misdiagnosed until you begin developing complications or worsening symptoms despite treatment.\n\nWhen blood sugar gets so high that diabetic ketoacidosis occurs, you become very ill. This is often the reason people end up in the hospital or their doctor’s office, and type 1 diabetes is then diagnosed.\n\nIf you have any of the symptoms of diabetes, your doctor will likely order tests.\n\nLearn how each of these tests is performed and what they show.",
        "## Complications\n\nThe two most common complications are hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nHypoglycemia happens when your blood sugar is too low, usually when your body has too much insulin. It can happen if you wait too long to eat or have a snack, or if you exercise too much.\n\nKetoacidosis can be a life threatening condition. This when your body doesn’t have enough insulin. Symptoms of this condition include:\n\n* rapid breathing\n\n* dry skinand mouth\n\n* flushed face\n\n* fruity breath odor\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting or stomach pain\n\nIn addition, high blood sugar levels can cause damage to various parts of the body. Symptoms can include:\n\n* increased heart attack risk\n\n* eye problems, including blindness\n\n* nerve damage\n\n* infections on the skin, especially the feet, that could require amputation in serious cases\n\n* kidney damage\n\nDiabetes can also damage your nerves and lead to a condition calleddiabetic neuropathy. This is common in the feet.\n\nSmall cuts, especially on the bottom of your feet, can quickly turn into severe ulcers and infections, especially if blood sugar levels aren’t controlled. This is because you can’t feel or see the cuts, so you don’t treat them.\n\nThat is why it’s important to check your feet regularly if you have diabetes. If you happen to notice any foot injuries, let your doctor know right away.",
        "## Type 1 diabetes in children\n\nType 1 diabetes was once known as juvenile diabetes. That is because it’s frequently diagnosed in children and young adults. By comparison, type 2 diabetes is typically diagnosed in older adults. However, both types can be diagnosed at almost any age.\n\nAccording to a2015 self-reported study, symptoms of diabetes in children include:\n\n* weight loss\n\n* wetting the bedor urinating more often\n\n* feeling weak orfatigued\n\n* being hungry or thirsty more often\n\n* mood changes\n\n* blurred vision\n\nAs in adults, children with type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin.\n\nThe first generation of anartificial pancreashas been recentlyapprovedfor use in children. This device is inserted under the skin. Then, it measures blood sugar continuously, automatically releasing the right amount of insulin as needed.\n\nMost children still use manual methods for insulin injections and glucose monitoring. In young children especially, this requires a lot of work byparentsto keep them safe and healthy.\n\nChildren with type 1 diabetescan and do live healthy, fulfilling lives.\n\nGet answers to questions about how children with diabetes can eat, play, and stay healthy.",
        "## Life expectancy and statistics\n\nCurrently, more than1.6 million Americansare living with type 1 diabetes, including about 187,000 children and adolescents.\n\nDiabetes (type 1 and type 2) is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, according to theCDC. About 5 to 10 percent of the people who have diabetes have type 1.\n\nProperlymanaging the conditioncan help reduce complications and prolong life expectancy.",
        "## Ketogenic diet\n\nTheketogenic (keto) diethas shown some benefits for people withtype 2 diabetes.\n\nThe high fat, low carb diet may help manage blood sugar levels, according to2018 research. It can even lead to weight loss, a goal for many people with type 2.\n\nFor type 1 diabetes, however, the keto diet hasn’t been well-studied. To date, the general dietary recommendation for this type of diabetes is alow carb diet. However, researchers are looking at the possible benefits and safety of a diet that restricts carbs even more for people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nOne small studyfound that people with type 1 diabetes who followed the keto diet for more than 2 years showed betterA1Cresults and glycemic control. However, these individuals also hadhigher blood lipidsand morelow blood sugar episodes. Long-term safety is unknown.\n\nIf you’re interested in trying the keto diet and you have type 1 diabetes, start by talking with your doctor. They may refer you to a registered dietitian or nutritionist to help you find a plan that is right for you.\n\nYou can learn more with this beginner’s guide to the keto diet.",
        "## Pregnancy\n\nPregnancy presents unique challenges for people who have type 1 diabetes. However, it’s possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby despite having this condition.\n\nThe most important thing to remember if you are expecting or trying to become pregnant and have type 1 diabetes is that everything you do for your body, you do for your baby. People who have high blood sugar levels have babies with high blood sugar.\n\nAccording to theCDC, high blood sugar levels during pregnancy can lead to complications such as:\n\n* a high birth weight\n\n* complicated cesarean delivery, commonly referred to as aC-section\n\n* preterm birth\n\n* low blood sugar\n\n* high blood pressure\n\n* stillbirth\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes and want to become pregnant or find out that you’re pregnant, talk with your doctor immediately. They can discuss any changes you may need to make to guarantee your blood sugar levels remain stable and safe for you and your baby.\n\nIt’s best to plan ahead for a pregnancy and discuss your diabetes and blood sugar goals with your doctor.\n\nDuring your pregnancy, you will likely need to see a healthcare professional more frequently. You may also need to adjust medication and insulin throughout the pregnancy.\n\nDoctors and patients share their tips for managing pregnancy with diabetes.",
        "## Drinking alcohol\n\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, alcohol can have a big impact on blood sugar levels in the short term. Over time, excessive alcohol use can contribute to complications of diabetes.\n\nThe liver is responsible for processing and removing alcohol from the body. The liver is also involved in managing blood sugar levels. If you have type 1 diabetes and drink alcohol, your body slows the management of blood sugar in order to deal with the alcohol.\n\nThis can lead to low blood sugar, immediately and for several hours after drinking. It’s important to test your blood sugar before drinking alcohol and to continue to monitor it afterward.",
        "## Lifestyle tips\n\nLiving with type 1 diabetes means maintaining consistent lifestyle strategies that include both a change to your diet and a safe exercise routine.",
        "### Diet\n\nTry to eat regular meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar stable. If you have access to one, a dietitian who is also a certified diabetes educator can help you establish aneating plan.\n\nSome tips to consider when developing your nutrition plan include:\n\n* Eat a balanced diet that includes vegetables, nonfat dairy, lean meats, plant proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and fruits.\n\n* Eat small meals. It’s better to eat more often in smaller portions and space your meals evenly throughout the day to keep your glucose level from spiking.\n\n* Never skip meals.",
        "### Exercising safely\n\nExercisehelps lower your blood sugar levels, and it is a vital part of the balanced lifestyle important for anyone with type 1 diabetes.\n\nBut, exercise can also be tricky for people with this condition. This is because your insulin amounts need to be adjusted according to your level of exercise.\n\nTry to aim to exercise at least150 minutes per week. Also, try to have no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise.Aerobic exerciseis good for people with type 1 diabetes, as arestrength trainingand resistance training.\n\nWhat’s unclear, however, is the best practice for managing blood glucose during exercise. That’s because blood sugar levels can spike or even crash during and after exercise, as your body’s cells begin using insulin or moving glucose more effectively.\n\nStill, experts suggest people with diabetes get regular exercise for optimal health. This may require working with your doctor or other expert to find a plan that is right for you.\n\nThis guide to blood sugar target levels and ranges for insulin may help you get started.\n\nLearn more about managing day-to-day life, symptoms, and preventing complications.",
        "## Takeaway\n\nType 1 diabetes is a condition that causes the body to be unable to process glucose due to a lack of insulin.\n\nThe cause is likely an autoimmune process. Experts believe it is influenced by genetics and environmental factors, and possibly by viral infections.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a different disease than type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut just like with the other form of diabetes, you can typically manage it with insulin, medications, and a balanced diet and exercise routine.\n\nIt’s important to consult with a doctor and to monitor your glucose regularly, as well as to be aware of potential complications and their symptoms.\n\nRead this article in Spanish.",

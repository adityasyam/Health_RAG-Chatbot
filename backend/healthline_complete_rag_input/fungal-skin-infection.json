        "# Everything You Need to Know About Fungal Skin Infections\n\nCandidiasis, scalp ringworm, jock itch, and athlete’s foot are all types of fungal skin infections. In some cases, oral antifungal medications may be required.",
        "## What is a fungal skin infection?\n\nFungi live everywhere. They can be found in soil, in the air, or even inside the body. They can also be found on plants, surfaces, or the skin. These microscopic organisms typically don’t cause any problems for your skin unless they multiply faster than normal or penetrate the skin through a cut or lesion.\n\nSince fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, fungal skin infections can often develop in sweaty or damp areas that don’t get much airflow. Some examples include the feet, groin, and folds of the skin.\n\nThese infections usually appear as a scaly rash or as discolored and often itchy skin.\n\nYou often acquire a fungal skin infection through direct contact. This can include coming into contact with fungi in or on:\n\n* another person\n\n* an animal\n\n* items such as clothing\n\n* gyms\n\n* gym mats, like those used in wrestling\n\n* hot tubs\n\n* saunasand steam rooms\n\nSome fungal skin infections are very common. Although the infection can be uncomfortable and possibly contagious, it’s typically not serious unless you’reimmunocompromised.\n\nAlthough there are millions of species of fungi, justa few hundred of themcan actually causeinfections in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nWhat’s more, only a few of those species are dermatophytes, which can affect the skin, nails, and hair. Nondermatophyte fungi can affect the nails but are more likely to occur in other places, such as the lungs or brain.",
        "## Types of fungal skin infections and their treatments\n\nMany common fungal infections can affect the skin.",
        "### Yeast infection (Candida skin infection)\n\nYeast is a type of fungus.\n\nA yeast calledCandidais naturally present on the skin and inside the human body. When itovergrows, an infection can occur, including on the skin. The most common species ofCandidaisCandida albicans.\n\nOther names for a yeast infection of the skin include:\n\n* aCandidaskin infection\n\n* a candidal skin infection\n\n* cutaneous candidiasis\n\n* candidiasis of the skin\n\nThe infection occurs in warm, moist, and poorly ventilated areas. Areas that are typically infected include the folds of the buttocks (as in certain types ofdiaper rash) andunder the breasts.\n\nThe symptoms of a yeast infection of the skin can include:\n\n* a red or discolored rash\n\n* itching\n\n* stinging\n\n* burning\n\n* acne-like bumps around the rash\n\nThe mucous membranes are another common site of fungal infections. Some examples of yeast infections in the mucous membranes arevaginal yeast infectionsandoral thrush.\n\nA primary care doctor should be able to diagnose a yeast infection of the skin during aphysical examination. They may also swab the skin and use askin cultureto confirm that yeast is the organism causing your symptoms.\n\nIf you see a dermatologist instead, they may perform a skin scraping of the rash and then view the sample under a microscope to determine if there’sCandidagrowth.\n\nAn important step in treating any yeast infection is keeping the skin clean and dry.\n\nSome yeast infections will go away on their own.Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal drugsare also available. These drugs can either kill fungi directly or prevent them from growing and thriving.\n\nTopical versions include:\n\n* clotrimazole\n\n* econazole\n\n* ketoconazole\n\n* nystatin\n\n* oxiconazole\n\nTo help reduce itching, you can also use acorticosteroid creamsuch as hydrocortisone.\n\nPowders may help you keep your skin dry. It’s important to apply them2 to 3hoursbefore or after applying any creams.\n\nIf the infection doesn’t resolve or improve, a doctor may prescribe oral antifungal medications, such as:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\nTo helptreat diaper rash, consider using zinc oxide creams to soothe your baby’s skin. OTC options include products from the brands:\n\n* A+D\n\n* Balmex\n\n* Desitin\n\n* Triple Paste\n\nHome remedies such as changing diapers more frequently and using disposable diapers may also relieve symptoms.",
        "### Ringworm of the body (tinea corporis)\n\nRingwormis a common fungal skin infection. It’s highly contagious but not serious.\n\nDespite its name, ringworm is caused by a fungus and not a worm. It typically occurs on the torso and limbs, in a subtype known asringworm of the body (tinea corporis). Ringworm on other areas of the body can go by different names, such as jock itch and athlete’s foot.\n\nThe main symptom of ringworm is a ring-shaped rash with slightly raised edges. The skin inside these circular rashes usually looks healthy. The rash can spread and is often itchy.\n\nRingworm can come from petting an animal infected with the fungus or from gyms and gym mats.\n\nA doctor can usually diagnose ringworm by sight or after performing a skin scraping.\n\nSome doctors may also perform afungal cultureto help them determine a diagnosis.\n\nRingworm of the body that’s limited to a few areas can usually be treated with a topical antifungal medication, such as:\n\n* clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF Ringworm Cream)\n\n* econazole\n\n* ketoconazole (Extina, Ketozole)\n\n* luliconazole (Luzu)\n\n* naftifine\n\n* oxiconazole (Oxistat)\n\n* sulconazole (Exelderm)\n\n* terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream, Silka Antifungal Cream)\n\nDoctors often recommend oral antifungals for a deeper or more extensive infection. They include:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)\n\n* terbinafine",
        "### If you think you have ringworm\n\nIf you think you may have ringworm, try to refrain from using over-the-counter antifungal products (such as creams) before you receive an official diagnosis.\n\nUsing these products can make the fungus harder to identify when a healthcare professional views it under a microscope.\n\nAccording to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over-the-counter antifungal products aren’t effective against ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis). This type of ringworm typically requires prescription antifungal products.",
        "### Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis)\n\nThis fungal infection affects the skin of the scalp and the associated hair shafts. It’s most common in children and teens3 to 14 years old.\n\nYou can contract ringworm of the scalp from animals, soil, or other humans (via hairbrushes or hats).\n\nSymptoms ofringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis)can include:\n\n* broken hair shafts\n\n* localized bald patches that may appear scaly or red\n\n* associated scaling anditching\n\n* associatedtenderness or painin the patches\n\n* patches that ooze or crust over\n\n* permanenthair loss, in some severe cases\n\nIt may resemble severedandruff.\n\nIt can also cause symptoms unrelated to the scalp, such asfeverandswollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n\nA doctor can diagnose ringworm of the scalp during a physical examination.\n\nThey usually perform a skin scraping, such as askin lesion KOH exam. In the skin lesion KOH exam, skin scrapings are mixed with potassium hydrochloride (KOH) to determine if fungi are present.\n\nRingworm of the scalp requires prescription oral medication, which may come in the form of a tablet, capsule, or liquid. Examples include:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* griseofulvin(Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is typically the drug of choice and is safe for children\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)\n\n* terbinafine\n\nEveryone with ringworm of the scalp should use an antifungal shampoo. All members of their household should use it too. Examples includeketoconazole shampoo(Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo).",
        "### Jock itch (tinea cruris)\n\nJock itchhappens in the area near yourgroinandthighs. It’s most common in men and adolescent boys.\n\nThe main symptom is an itchy, red, and sometimes painful rash that typically starts in the groin or around the upper inner thighs. The rash may worsen after exercise or other physical activity and can spread to the buttocks and abdomen.\n\nThe affected skin may also appear:\n\n* scaly\n\n* flaky\n\n* cracked\n\n* moist and possiblymacerated, in the case of an open sore\n\nThe outer border of the rash can be slightly raised and darker.\n\nA doctor can diagnose jock itch during a physical examination or after examining a sample under a microscope.\n\nTreatment often begins with OTC or prescription creams.\n\nOTC creams, sprays, and powders include:\n\n* butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra Jock Itch Cream)\n\n* clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF Jock Itch Antifungal Cream)\n\n* miconazole (CareALL Miconazole Cream, Lotrimin AF Jock Itch Antifungal Powder Spray)\n\n* terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream for Jock Itch, Silka Antifungal Cream, Silka Jock Itch Cream)\n\nPrescription creams include:\n\n* econazole\n\n* ketoconazole (Ketozole)\n\n* luliconazole (Luzu)\n\n* oxiconazole (Oxistat)\n\n* sulconazole (Exelderm)\n\nApplying acool compresscan also help soothe the skin.\n\nIf topical treatments don’t work, a doctor may prescribe oral antifungals, such as:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)\n\n* terbinafine\n\nOral medications are typically reserved for recurrent, treatment-resistant, or chronic infections.",
        "### Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor)\n\nIntinea versicolor, small oval discolored patches develop on the skin. It’s sometimes called pityriasis versicolor.\n\nThis infection is caused by an overgrowth of a fungus calledMalassezia.Malasseziais naturally present on the skin of most adults.\n\nThe discolored skin patches mostly occur on the back, chest, and upper arms, but they can also affect the scalp. They may looklighterordarkerthan the rest of the skin and can be red, pink, tan, or brown. On people with darker skin, the patches may appear white. These patches can be itchy, flaky, or scaly.\n\nTinea versicolor is more likely to appear during the summer or in areas with a warm, wet climate. It’s also common in people who work out orsweatoften. The condition can sometimes return following treatment.\n\nA doctor can diagnose tinea versicolor with a:\n\n* physical examination\n\n* Wood’s lamp examination, in which a healthcare professional uses a handheld blacklight to confirm the presence of fungi or bacteria\n\n* skin lesion biopsy, which involves removing a small skin sample and having it tested in a laboratory\n\n* skin lesion KOH exam\n\nThe standard treatment for tinea versicolor is topical products such as soaps, creams, lotions, and shampoos. Ingredients to look for include:\n\n* ketoconazole, found in products such as prescription-strength shampoo and Extina foam\n\n* pyrithione zinc, found in products such as Vanicream Z-Bar Medicated Cleansing Bar, Vanicream Dandruff Shampoo, and Selsun blue Itchy Dry Scalp Antidandruff Shampoo\n\n* selenium sulfide, found in products such as Selsun blue Moisturizing Antidandruff Shampoo and Selsun blue Medicated Antidandruff Shampoo\n\nIf tinea versicolor returns following treatment, a doctor may recommend you use a medicated cleanseronce or twice a month.\n\nOral medication is rarely needed. A doctor may prescribe a short course of oral antifungals if tinea versicolor is recurrent, treatment-resistant, widespread, severe, or creates thick scales.\n\nThey include:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)",
        "### Athlete’s foot (tinea pedis)\n\nAthlete’s footaffects the skin on your feet, often between your toes. It can also appear on the soles of your feet.\n\nTypical symptoms of athlete’s foot include:\n\n* itchingor aburning, stinging sensation between your toes or on the soles\n\n* skin that appearsred, scaly, dry, orflaky\n\n* peeling skin\n\n* thickened soles\n\n* crackedorblisteredskin\n\n* deep blisters on the soles, in rare cases\n\nIn some cases, the infection can also spread to other areas. Examples include the:\n\n* nails, as in onychomycosis\n\n* groin, as in jock itch (tinea cruris)\n\n* hands, as intinea manuum\n\nA doctor can diagnose athlete’s foot by observing your symptoms or performing a skin test such as the skin lesion KOH exam.\n\nYou can treat athlete’s foot with a variety of OTC topical products, such as:\n\n* butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra Athlete’s Foot Cream)\n\n* clotrimazole (CareALL Athlete’s Foot Cream, Lotrimin AF Cream for Athlete’s Foot)\n\n* miconazole (Desenex Athlete’s Foot Shake Powder)\n\n* terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream, Lamisil AT Cream for Athlete’s Foot, Silka Antifungal Cream)\n\n* tolnaftate (Dr. Scholl’s Odor-X Antifungal Spray Powder, Lotrimin AF Athlete’s Foot Daily Prevention Deodorant Powder Spray, Tinactin Athlete’s Foot Cream)\n\nTerbinafine tends to be the fastest-acting of these medications.\n\nIf OTC products don’t help clear up athlete’s footwithin 2 weeksor so, a doctor may prescribe:\n\n* prescription-strength topical clotrimazole\n\n* sulconazole (Exelderm)\n\nDoctors usually prescribe oral antifungals when the infection is recurrent, causes blisters, or involves the tops of the feet, soles, or heels. They include:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is safe for children\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)\n\n* terbinafine\n\nAthlete’s foot tends to recur, so it’s important to dry the toes and feet thoroughly after showering or bathing. Use a powder, especially in between the toes.",
        "### Onychomycosis\n\nOnychomycosis is afungal infection of the nails. It can affect the fingernails or the toenails, although infections of the toenails are7 to 10 timesmore common.\n\nSymptoms of onychomycosis include nails that:\n\n* haveflaky white patchesandpitsnear the top\n\n* arediscolored(typicallyyellow, brown,black, purplish, green, or white)\n\n* arebrittleor break easily\n\n* arethick\n\n* are raised or crusty, in the case of toenails\n\nA doctor will usually take a nail clipping and some subfungal debris and send them off for a periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain or culture.\n\nOn some occasions, they may perform a skin lesion KOH exam. However, the PAS stains and cultures are more accurate.\n\nPrescription medications are often required to treat this type of infection. The standard treatment is oral terbinafine. It’s typically prescribedfor 6 or 12 weeks, depending on whether you have a fingernail or toenail infection.\n\nTreatment is notoriously tricky due to factors such as prolonged treatment time and the likelihood of recurrence.\n\nOther oral antifungals that may be used include:\n\n* fluconazole (Diflucan)\n\n* griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is safe for children\n\n* itraconazole (Sporanox)\n\nDoctors often prescribe topical antifungals as well. They include:\n\n* ciclopirox (Ciclodan)\n\n* efinaconazole (Jublia)\n\n* tavaborole (Kerydin)\n\nIn severe cases, a doctor may remove some or all of an affected nail.\n\nEmerging treatment options include lasers and light therapy. More data on their effectiveness is needed.",
        "## Fungal skin rash\n\nBecause a rash is a common symptom of most fungal skin infections, they’re often referred to as fungal skin rashes or fungal rashes. Onychomycosis is one of the few fungal skin infections that doesn’t typically cause a rash.",
        "## Risk factors for fungal skin infections\n\nSeveral factors can increase your risk of getting a fungal skin infection. They include:\n\n* living in a warm or wet environment\n\n* sweating heavily\n\n* not keeping your skin clean and dry\n\n* sharing items such as clothing, shoes, towels, or bedding\n\n* wearing tight clothing or footwear that doesn’t breathe well\n\n* taking part in activities that involve frequent skin-to-skin contact\n\n* coming into contact with animals that may be infected\n\n* having aweakened immune systemdue toimmunosuppressant drugs, cancer treatment, or conditions such as HIV or AIDS",
        "## Prevention of fungal skin infections\n\nTo help prevent a fungal skin infection from developing, try to keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Be sure to practicegood hygiene.\n\n* Do not share clothing, towels, or other personal items.\n\n* Wear clean clothes every day, particularly socks and underwear.\n\n* Choose clothing and shoes that breathe well. Avoid clothing or shoes that are too tight or have a restrictive fit.\n\n* Make sure to dry off properly with a clean and dry towel after showering, bathing, or swimming.\n\n* Wear sandals or flip-flops in locker rooms instead of walking with bare feet.\n\n* Wipe down shared surfaces, such as gym equipment or mats.\n\n* Stay away from animals that have signs of a fungal infection, such as missing fur or frequent scratching.",
        "## When to contact a doctor\n\nFungal skin infections are common.\n\nAlthough these infections aren’t usually serious, they can cause discomfort and irritation due to itchy or scaly red skin. If not treated, the rash may spread or become more irritated.\n\nMany fungal skin infections eventually improve in response to OTC fungal treatments. However, call a doctor or other healthcare professional if you:\n\n* have a fungal skin infection that does not improve, gets worse, or returns after OTC treatment\n\n* notice patches of hair loss along with itchiness or scaly skin\n\n* have a weakened immune system and suspect a fungal infection\n\n* havediabetesand think you haveathlete’s footoronychomycosis\n\nIf you are immunocompromised or have diabetes, an untreated infection can lead tocellulitisor systemic infection.\n\nAlso, call a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have an infection that does not improve with OTC medications. You may need a prescription for more effective treatment.",

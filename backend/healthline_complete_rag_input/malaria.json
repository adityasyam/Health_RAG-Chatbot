It causes symptoms like high fever and sweating, diagnosed by blood tests, and primarily affects individuals traveling from non-endemic to endemic regions. Though treatable with medication, it requires careful diagnosis due to possible drug resistance.",

        "# Malaria\n\nWhat is malaria?\n\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease. It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infectedAnophelesmosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry thePlasmodiumparasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.\n\nOnce the parasites are inside your body, they travel to theliver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infectred blood cells.\n\nWithin 48 to 72 hours, the parasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open.\n\nThe parasites continue to infect red blood cells, resulting in symptoms that occur in cycles that last two to three days at a time.\n\nMalaria is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can live. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)states that, in 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries.\n\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report1,700 casesof malaria annually. Most cases of malaria develop in people whotravel to countrieswhere malaria is more common.",
        "## What causes malaria?\n\nMalaria can occur if a mosquito infected with thePlasmodiumparasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans:Plasmodium vivax,P. ovale,P. malariae, andP. falciparum.\n\nP. falciparumcauses a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria.\n\nMalaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through:\n\n* an organ transplant\n\n* atransfusion\n\n* use of shared needles or syringes",
        "## What are the symptoms of malaria?\n\nThe symptoms of malaria typically develop within 10 days to 4 weeks following the infection. In some cases, symptoms may not develop for several months. Some malarial parasites can enter the body but will be dormant for long periods of time.\n\nCommon symptoms of malaria include:\n\n* shakingchillsthat can range from moderate to severe\n\n* highfever\n\n* profusesweating\n\n* headache\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* abdominal pain\n\n* diarrhea\n\n* anemia\n\n* muscle pain\n\n* convulsions\n\n* coma\n\n* bloody stools",
        "## How is malaria diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor will be able to diagnose malaria. During your appointment, your doctor will review your health history, including any recent travel to tropical climates. A physical exam will also be performed.\n\nYour doctor will be able to determine if you have anenlarged spleenorliver. If you have symptoms of malaria, your doctor may order additional blood tests to confirm your diagnosis.\n\nThese tests will show:\n\n* whether you have malaria\n\n* what type of malaria you have\n\n* if your infection is caused by aparasitethat’s resistant to certain types of drugs\n\n* if the disease has caused anemia\n\n* if the disease has affected your vital organs",
        "## Life-threatening complications of malaria\n\nMalaria can cause a number of life-threatening complications. The following may occur:\n\n* swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, or cerebral malaria\n\n* an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that causes breathing problems, orpulmonary edema\n\n* organ failure of thekidneys,liver, or spleen\n\n* anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells\n\n* low blood sugar",
        "## How is malaria treated?\n\nMalaria can be a life-threatening condition, especially if you’re infected with the parasiteP. falciparum. Treatment for the disease is typically provided in a hospital. Your doctor will prescribe medications based on the type of parasite that you have.\n\nIn some instances, the medication prescribed may not clear the infection because of parasite resistance to drugs. If this occurs, your doctor may need to use more than one medication or change medications altogether to treat your condition.\n\nAdditionally, certain types of malaria parasites, such asP. vivaxandP. ovale, have liver stages where the parasite can live in your body for an extended period of time and reactivate at a later date causing a relapse of the infection.\n\nIf you’re found to have one of these types of malaria parasites, you’ll be given a second medication to prevent a relapse in the future.",
        "## What’s the long-term outlook for people with malaria?\n\nPeople with malaria who receive treatment typically have a good long-term outlook. If complications arise as a result of malaria, the outlook may not be as good. Cerebral malaria, which causes swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, can result inbrain damage.\n\nThe long-term outlook for patients with drug-resistant parasites may also be poor. In these patients, malaria may recur. This may cause other complications.",
        "## Tips to prevent malaria\n\nThere’s no vaccine available to prevent malaria. Talk to your doctor if you’re traveling to an area where malaria is common or if you live in such an area. You may be prescribed medications to prevent the disease.\n\nThese medications are the same as those used to treat the disease and should be taken before, during, and after your trip.\n\nTalk to your doctor about long-term prevention if you live in an area where malaria is common. Sleeping under amosquito netmay help prevent being bitten by an infected mosquito. Covering your skin or usingbug sprays containing DEET] may also help prevent infection.\n\nIf you’re unsure if malaria is prevalent in your area, the CDC has an up-to-datemapof where malaria can be found.",

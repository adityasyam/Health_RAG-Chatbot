TTH may also significantly impact the quality of life for those affected.\n\nTTH causes head pain that may occur across both sides and the front and back of theskull. In other words, your entire head may feel pain.\n\nPeople affected by TTH may easily ignore the headache episodes because the pain tends to be mild to moderate, not aggravated by daily physical activity, and doesn‘t cause disability.\n\nHowever, if untreated, TTH may become a chronic (long-term) issue that leads to complications like:\n\n* sleep disruption\n\n* jaw muscle and joint disorders\n\n* anxiety\n\n* depression",
        "### Cluster headache\n\nAcluster headacheis rare, affectingless than 1 percentof the population.\n\nThis headache frequently occurs throughout the day.

This condition is considered a secondary headache disorder. MOH is also sometimes described as “rebound headache“ or “medication withdrawal headache.“\n\nMOH commonly occurs with chronic migraine episodes or tension headaches. One of the features of MOH is taking pain medication for at least10 days per monthfor more than 3 months.\n\nA2022 reviewindicated MOH as a factor in people who experience disability from chronic migraine, since the medication they take to treat their migraine headaches leads to more headaches.",
        "### New daily persistent headache (NDPH)\n\nAnew daily persistent headache (NDPH)is a sudden onset headache that doesn‘t stop within 24 hours and reoccurs almost daily. Although not as common as some other headache types, it may cause disabling symptoms and affect your quality of life.\n\nOnly an estimated0.03 to 0.1 percentof the general population experience NDPH, but its pain is constant with an unknown cause. It typically develops in those with no previous or significant headache history.",

Additionally, people with the condition may experience periods of severe pain instead of the constant pain already felt, making this a debilitating headache.\n\nTo fit thecriteriafor this headache, you must:\n\n* have a one-sided daily or continuous headache of moderate intensity\n\n* experience additional short-lived and piercing head pains\n\n* feel it for more than 3 months without shifting sides or pain-free periods\n\n* respond to treatment with the medicationindomethacin",
        "### Pregnancy headaches\n\nHeadaches are common inpregnancy.\n\nA 2021 review of studies estimated that10 to 17 percentof pregnant people experience primary headaches or migraine.\n\nDuring pregnancy, you may experience stress and significant hormonal changes that lead to headaches.\n\nSome medications can be harmful to the mother or fetus.

Usually, the pain is intense and throbbing in only one area of the head.\n\nOther symptoms of a migraine headache include:\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* light sensitivity\n\n* sound sensitivity\n\nThis type of headache is more common in women by a2-to-1 ratiowhen compared with men, which may be attributed to female hormones.\n\nA2018 review of studiessuggests that migraine in females can be influenced by hormone fluctuations, such as those seen in:\n\n* themenstrual cycle\n\n* pregnancy\n\n* menopause\n\n* the use of oral contraceptives\n\n* those undergoinghormone replacement therapy\n\nThe cause of migraine headaches may be a combination of factors, butresearchersbelieve it may also be due to changes in the activity of the brain’s nerve pathways and chemicals.",
        "### Stages of migraine headaches\n\nMigraine headaches can be predictable because some start with anaura. An aura is a visual disturbance that can appear as:\n\n* flashing lights\n\n* zigzag lines\n\n* temporary vision loss right before the headache\n\nMigraine headaches are sometimes preceded by a prodrome, or “preheadache,“ and some migraine episodes may have an aura before or during the headache.\n\nHere are all thestagesof migraine headaches:\n\n* Premonitory phase.May occur as early as 3 days before a migraine headache, and you can experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, and muscle tenderness.\n\n* Aura.Approximatelyone-thirdof migraine attacks include an aura, which may last only minutes and develops gradually.\n\n* Headache.Throbbing pain or other associated symptoms may occur during this stage.",

Consider that problems such as swelling due to a brain tumor or inflammation can also cause changes that would be detected during an eye exam.\n\n* Ordering lab blood tests.To rule out other potential causes for your headache, lab testing of your blood will show your doctor if there are any other concerns, such as infection.\n\n* Performing a spinal tap.In some cases, brain conditions like inflammation and bleeding may cause headaches.

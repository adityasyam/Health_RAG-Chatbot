These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as a blow to the head.\n\n* Infection.A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, calledvestibular neuritisorlabyrinthitis, can cause intense, constant vertigo.\n\n* Meniere’s disease.When excessive fluid builds up in the inner ear, the result can besudden episodesof vertigo that last for several hours.\n\n* Migraine.Migraine-induced vertigo can last minutes to hours.\n\n* Head or neck injury.Vertigo is a common symptom after a traumatic injury to the head or neck, especially if there is damage to the vestibular system.\n\n* Medications.Certain medications cancausevertigo, along with other symptoms like dizziness, hearing loss, andtinnitus, or a ringing in the ears.",

        "### Repositioning maneuvers\n\nThe canalith repositioning maneuver, also known as theEpley maneuver, is used torelievesymptoms of BPPV.\n\nThese specific head maneuvers can help displace canalith crystals (small particles that can cause vertigo) from the canals of the inner ear.\n\nEach treatment session involves holding four positions for 30 to 60 seconds each and repeating each position several times, as needed.\n\nA healthcare professional can guide you through each movement during the session. They may also provide additional guidance on how to perform this procedure at home.",

They typically involve marching in place or holding specific positions to improve balance.\n\nThese exercises are similar to the ones used in vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).\n\nVRT involves exercisesdesignedaccording to each person and their symptoms. After a thorough clinical examination, one of three main methods is applied:\n\n* habituation, which improves dizziness\n\n* gaze stabilization, which improves control of eye movements so vision can be clear during head movement\n\n* balance training, which improves steadiness\n\nHowever, if you have severe vertigo, it’s best to reach out to an experienced physical therapist for additional guidance, instead of performing these exercises on your own.",
        "### Surgery\n\nSurgery may be necessary for the treatment of certain underlying conditions that can cause vertigo, such as a brain tumor orhead injury.\n\nThere are several ways to naturally relieve discomfort caused by vertigo.\n\nFor example, certain supplements can help improve sleep while dealing with vertigo, includingginkgo bilobaandmelatonin.\n\nThere are also manyexercises for vertigothat youcan performat home, such asBrandt-Daroff exercises, theSemont maneuver, and the Foster maneuver.",

These include head impulse testing or theDix-Hallpike maneuver(patients are quickly lowered from a seated position to lying down).\n\nIn some cases, additional testing may be needed to diagnose vertigo, including imaging, hearing exams, and balance tests.",
        "## How long does vertigo last?\n\nThe signs and symptoms of BPPV cancome and go, with symptoms commonly lasting less than a minute.\n\nIn cases of Meniere’s disease, an episode of vertigo can last for longer than 20 minutes.\n\nMigraine-induced vertigo can last minutes to hours.\n\nLearn more about the duration of vertigo here.",
        "## Vertigo vs. dizziness\n\nAlthough vertigo and dizziness are often confused, vertigo is typically described as feeling like the world is spinning, even when there is no movement.\n\nWhile dizziness is a more ambiguous term, patients will often interpret it as a sense of imbalance within their own space.",

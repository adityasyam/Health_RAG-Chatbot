        "# Identifying Bug Bites and Stings, and How to Treat Them\n\nThe initial contact of a bite or sting from a bug may be painful. It is often followed by an allergic reaction to venom deposited into your skin through the mouth or stinger of the big. The appearance can vary.\n\nWhether you’re in the water, on a mountain trail, or in your backyard, wildlife you encounter have ways of protecting themselves and their territory.\n\nInsects, such as bees, ants, spiders, and scorpions, may bite or sting if you get close. Most of these animals won’t bother you if you don’t bother them, but knowing what to look for is key.\n\nMost bites and stings trigger nothing more than minor discomfort, but some encounters can be deadly, especially if you have severe allergies to the animal’s venom.\n\nA severe allergic reaction can happen with any bug bite or sting, depending on the person. Venom allergies may cause a dangerous, severe allergic reaction in some people, resulting in swelling, generalized itching, and difficulty breathing.\n\nPrevention is the best medicine, so knowing how to recognize and avoid biting and stinging insects or arachnids is the best way to stay safe.",

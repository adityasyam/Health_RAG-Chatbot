        "# Everything You Need to Know About Kidney Stones\n\nKidney stones, or renal calculi, are solid masses made of crystals. They can develop anywhere along your urinary tract, which consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.\n\nKidney stones can be a painful medical issue. The causes of kidney stones vary according to the type of stones.\n\nNot all kidney stones are made up of the same crystals. The different types of kidney stones include:",
        "### Calcium\n\nCalcium stones are themost common. They’re often made ofcalcium oxalate, though they can consist of calcium phosphate or maleate.\n\nEatingfewer oxalate-rich foodscan reduce your risk of developing this type of stone. High-oxalate foodsinclude:\n\n* potato chips\n\n* peanuts\n\n* chocolate\n\n* spinach\n\nHowever, even though some kidney stones are made of calcium, getting enough calcium in your diet can prevent stones from forming.",
        "### Uric acid\n\nThis type of kidney stone is thesecond most common. They can occur in people withgout,diabetes,obesity, and other types ofmetabolic syndrome.\n\nThis type of stone develops when urine is too acidic. A diet rich in purinescan increaseurine’s acidic level. Purine is a colorless substance in animal proteins, such as fish, shellfish, and meats.",
        "### Struvite\n\nThis type of stone is foundmostlyin people withurinary tract infections (UTIs). These stones can be large and cause urinary obstruction.\n\nStruvite stones result from akidney infection. Treating an underlying infection can prevent the development of struvite stones.",
        "### Cystine\n\nAbout1 in 7,000people worldwide get cystine kidney stones. They occur in both men and women who have the genetic disordercystinuria.\n\nWith this type of stone, cystine — an acid that occurs naturally in the body — leaks from the kidneys into the urine.",
        "## Symptoms and signs of a kidney stone\n\nKidney stones can cause severe pain. Symptoms of kidney stones may not occur until the stone begins to move down theureters. This severe pain is calledrenal colic. Youmay havepain on one side of your back or abdomen.\n\nIn men, pain may radiate to the groin area. The pain of renal colic comes and goes but can be intense. People with renal colic tend to be restless.\n\nOther symptoms of kidney stones caninclude:\n\n* blood in the urine(red, pink, or brown urine)\n\n* vomiting\n\n* nausea\n\n* discolored orfoul-smelling urine\n\n* chills\n\n* fever\n\n* frequent need to urinate\n\n* urinating small amounts of urine\n\nIn the case of a small kidney stone, you may not have any pain or symptoms as the stone passes through your urinary tract.",
        "## Causes of kidney stones\n\nKidney stones are most likely to occur in people between theages of 20 and 50.\n\nDifferent factors can increase your risk of developing a stone. In the United States,white peopleare more likely to have kidney stones than Black people.\n\nSex also plays a role. More men than women develop kidney stones, according to theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nA history of kidney stones can increase your risk. So does a family history of kidney stones.\n\nOther risk factorsinclude:\n\n* dehydration\n\n* obesity\n\n* a diet with high levels of protein, salt, or glucose\n\n* hyperparathyroid condition\n\n* gastric bypass surgery\n\n* inflammatory bowel diseasesthat increase calcium absorption\n\n* taking medications such as triamterenediuretics, antiseizure drugs, and calcium-based antacids",
        "## How kidney stones are treated\n\nTreatment is tailored according to the type of stone. Urine can be strained and stones collected for evaluation.\n\nDrinking six to eight glasses of water a day increases urine flow. People who are dehydrated or have severenausea and vomitingmayneedintravenous fluids.\n\nOther treatment options include:",
        "### Medication\n\nPain reliefmay requirenarcotic medications. The presence of infection requires treatment withantibiotics. Other medications include:\n\n* allopurinol(Zyloprim) for uric acid stones\n\n* thiazide diureticsto prevent calcium stones from forming\n\n* sodium bicarbonate orsodium citrateto make the urine less acidic\n\n* phosphorussolutions to prevent calcium stones from forming\n\n* ibuprofen(Advil) for pain\n\n* acetaminophen(Tylenol) for pain\n\n* naproxensodium (Aleve) for pain",
        "### Lithotripsy\n\nExtracorporeal shock wavelithotripsyuses sound waves to break up large stones so they can more easily pass down the ureters into your bladder.\n\nThis procedure can be uncomfortable andmay requirelightanesthesia. It can cause bruising on the abdomen and back and bleeding around the kidney and nearby organs.",
        "### Tunnel surgery (percutaneous nephrolithotomy)\n\nA surgeonremovesthe stones through a small incision in your back. A person may need this procedure when:\n\n* the stone causes obstruction and infection or is damaging the kidneys\n\n* the stone has grown too large to pass\n\n* pain can’t be managed",
        "### Ureteroscopy\n\nWhen a stone is stuck in the ureter or bladder, your doctor may use an instrument called a ureteroscope to remove it.\n\nA small wire with a camera attached is inserted into the urethra and passed into the bladder. The doctor then uses a small cage to snag the stone and remove it. The stone is then sent to the laboratory for analysis.",
        "### Pain management\n\nPassing a kidney stone can cause pain and discomfort.\n\nYour doctor may recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help reduce symptoms.\n\nFor severe pain, your doctor may alsoprescribeanarcoticor inject an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ketorolac (Toradol).\n\nOther natural remedies may also provide short-term relief from symptoms, including taking a hot bath or shower or applying a heating pad to the affected area.",
        "## Testing for and diagnosing kidney stones\n\nDiagnosis of kidney stones requires a complete health history assessment and aphysical exam. Other testsinclude:\n\n* blood tests for calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, and electrolytes\n\n* blood urea nitrogen (BUN)and creatinine to assess kidney functioning\n\n* urinalysisto check for crystals, bacteria, blood, and white cells\n\n* examination of passed stones to determine their type\n\nThe following tests can rule out obstruction:\n\n* abdominal X-rays\n\n* intravenous pyelogram (IVP)\n\n* retrograde pyelogram\n\n* ultrasoundof the kidney (the preferred test)\n\n* MRI scanof the abdomen and kidneys\n\n* abdominal CT scan\n\nThe contrast dye used in the CT scan and the IVP can affect kidney function. However, in people with normal kidney function, this isn’t a concern.\n\nThere are some medications that can increase the potential for kidney damage in conjunction with the dye. Make sure your radiologist knows about any medications you’re taking.",
        "## Passing a kidney stone\n\nPassing a kidney stone is a process that typically occurs in stages over a period of several weeks.",
        "### Stages\n\nHere are the stages thatoccurwhen passing a kidney stone:\n\n* Stage 1.After a kidney stone has formed, you may experience spasms as your kidneys try to push out the stone. This can cause severe pain in your back or side, which may come and go in waves.\n\n* Stage 2.During this stage, the stone enters the ureter, which is the tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder. Depending on the size of the stone, this stage can also cause feelings of pain and intense pressure.\n\n* Stage 3.Once the stone has reached the bladder, most of the pain will subside. However, you may feel an increased pressure in the bladder and a need to urinate more frequently. In some cases, the stone may temporarily get stuck at the opening of the urethra, which could block the flow of urine.\n\n* Stage 4.The final stage occurs once the stone has reached the urethra. During this stage, you need to push hard to pass the kidney stone with the urine through the opening of the urethra.",
        "### How long does it take to pass a kidney stone?\n\nThe amount of time that it takes to pass a kidney stone can vary depending on the size of the stone. Generally, small stones are able to pass through the urine within1-2 weeks, often without any treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, larger stones may take 2-3 weeks to move through the kidneys and into the bladder.\n\nStones that don’t pass on their own within 4 weeks typically require medical treatment.",
        "## How to prevent kidney stones\n\nProper hydration is a key preventive measure. It’s recommended to drink enough fluid to pass at least2.5 litersof urine each day. Increasing the amount of urine you pass helps flush the kidneys.\n\nYou can substitute ginger ale, lemon-lime soda, and fruit juice for water to help you increase your fluid intake. If the stones are related to low citrate levels, citratejuicescould help prevent the formation of stones.\n\nEating oxalate-rich foods in moderation and reducing your intake of salt and animal proteins can also lower your risk of kidney stones.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe medications to help prevent the formation of calcium and uric acid stones. If you’ve had a kidney stone or you’re at risk for a kidney stone, speak with your doctor and discuss the best methods of prevention.",
        "## Foods that can cause kidney stones\n\nIn addition to drinking more water, making modifications to your diet could also help prevent kidney stones.\n\nHere are some foods that you may need tolimitor avoid:\n\n* beef\n\n* chicken\n\n* pork\n\n* organ meats\n\n* fish\n\n* shellfish\n\n* eggs\n\n* milk\n\n* cheese\n\n* yogurt\n\n* processed meats\n\n* fast food\n\n* frozen meals\n\n* salty snacks\n\nAnimal proteins like meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products can increase levels of uric acid in your urine and increase the risk of developing kidney stones.",
        "## When to see a doctor\n\nIn many cases, small kidney stones can pass on their own and don’t require any treatment.\n\nIf you’re able to manage your pain with over-the-counter medications and don’t have any signs of infection or severe symptoms like nausea or vomiting, you may not need treatment.\n\nHowever, if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention:\n\n* blood in the urine\n\n* fever\n\n* chills\n\n* cloudy or foul-smelling urine\n\n* vomiting\n\n* severe pain in your back or side\n\n* pain or burning when you urinate\n\n* difficulty urinating\n\nIf you’re unable to see your doctor, you should go to the emergency room to receive treatment.\n\nIf you have recurrent kidney stones, you should talk to your doctor, even if your symptoms resolve without treatment.\n\nYour doctor can helpdevelop a planto prevent kidney stones from forming and protect against long-term complications.\n\nIf you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.",
        "## Takeaway\n\nAlthough kidney stones can be a painful and frustrating issue to deal with, there are several different treatment options available.\n\nIn fact, there are many medications and procedures that can help manage symptoms and promote the passage of kidney stones.\n\nAdditionally, staying well-hydrated and making changes to your diet can prevent kidney stones from forming in the long run.",

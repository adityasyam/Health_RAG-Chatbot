It develops when substance use interferes with the ability to function day to day. It can occur with prescription or nonprescription drugs.\n\nMedical professionals previously used the term “drug abuse” to describe substance use disorder. Another term for substance use disorder is addiction. This differs fromdependence.\n\nSubstance misuse greatly affects public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than70,000 peoplein the United States died fromoverdosesin 2017. And every year, around88,000 peopledie fromexcessive alcohol usein the United States.\n\nSubstance misuse also leads to other public health problems, such as:\n\n* drunk and impaired driving\n\n* violence\n\n* familial stress\n\n* potential forchild abuse and neglect\n\nSharing or reusing needles for intravenous drug use also increases the risk of contracting and transmittinginfectious diseases, includingHIVandhepatitis.\n\nTheAmerican Psychiatric Association (APA)describessubstance use disorderas a brain disease. It’s characterized by repeated substance use despite negative effects. Substance use disorder involves many social and biological factors.\n\nThe most successful way to prevent substance use disorder is through education.",
        "## Risk factors\n\nSubstance misuse and addiction can affect anyone. However, there are some things that may increase the chance of developing a substance use disorder.\n\nAs is the case with many conditions, genetics play a key role in addiction. Research indicates that genetic factors may be responsible for40 to 60 percentof an individual’s susceptibility to developing a substance use disorder.\n\nOther risk factors for developing substance misuse issues include:\n\n* physical,sexual, oremotionalabuse\n\n* exposure totrauma\n\n* family members or peers who use or misuse substances\n\n* access to these substances\n\n* mental health disorders, such as:depressionanxietyeating disorderspersonality disorderssubstance use at an early age\n\n* depression\n\n* anxiety\n\n* eating disorders\n\n* personality disorders\n\n* substance use at an early age",
        "### Adolescent substance misuse\n\nAdolescents are likely to experiment with substances. Their brains aren’t fully developed, so they don’t have the same decision making abilities as adults. As such, they may develop substance misuse issues.\n\nRisk factors for adolescent substance misuse include:\n\n* parents or family members who misuse substances\n\n* childhood mistreatment, such asabuseorneglect\n\n* peer pressure to use substances\n\n* bullying\n\n* gang affiliation\n\n* certain conditions, likeADHDordepression\n\nHaving one or more of these risk factors doesn’t mean someone will develop an addiction. However, the more risk factors present, the greater the likelihood substance use will progress to misuse or addiction.",
        "## Depressants\n\nSubstances classified as depressants (or central nervous system depressants) reduce activity in yourcentral nervous system (CNS). They make you feel relaxed anddrowsy.\n\nHowever, depressants’ effects vary depending on the amount consumed and an individual’s specific reaction to the substance.\n\nFor example, low doses of depressants can actually have a stimulant effect and cause a euphoric feeling. Larger doses cause depressant effects, such as cognitive impairment orloss of coordination.",

Symptoms and treatments may vary depending on the type of allergy you have.\n\nThe immune system is responsible for keeping you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens.\n\nIt does this bycreating antibodiescalled immunoglobulin. There are several types of immunoglobulins, which fight against possible agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals. Immunoglobin E (IgE) is a type that responds to certain substances and causes an allergic reaction.\n\nAllergic reactions may involve a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild inflammation to life threatening situations.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),1 in 3 peoplehave an allergy in the United States.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about the types, symptoms, and causes of allergies, as well as how to treat them.\n\nSometimes, allergic reactions may cause symptoms that could be life threatening, known asanaphylaxis.\n\nIf you or someone you know suddenly experiences any of the following symptoms, call 911 or get immediate medical attention:\n\n* swelling in the face, throat, and tongue\n\n* dizziness, confusion, fainting\n\n* difficulty breathing, swallowing, and speaking\n\n* wheezing or coughing\n\n* skin discoloration, such as blue, pale, or gray tongue\n\nIf you or the person has an epinephrine autoinjector, use it immediately.

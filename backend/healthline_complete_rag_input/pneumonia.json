        "# Pneumonia: Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Treatment\n\n**Description**: Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. General symptoms include chest pain, fever, cough, and trouble breathing.\n\n\nBezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions.

Connect with us for all things health.",
        "# Everything You Need to Know About Pneumonia\n\nPneumonia is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It leads to inflammation in the air sacs of one or both lungs. These sacs, called alveoli, fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nBothviralandbacterialpneumonia iscontagious. This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough.\n\nYou can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.\n\nYou can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment. It does not spread from person to person.",
        "## Types of pneumonia\n\nPneumonia is further classified according to where or how it was acquired:\n\n* Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics.\n\n* Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).This refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.\n\n* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it’s called VAP.\n\n* Aspiration pneumonia.Inhaling bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva can causeaspiration pneumonia. It’s more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem, or if you’re too sedated from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs.",
        "### Walking pneumonia\n\nWalking pneumoniais a milder case of pneumonia. People with walking pneumonia may not even know they have pneumonia. Their symptoms may feel more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia. However, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period.\n\nThe symptoms of walking pneumonia can include things like:\n\n* mild fever\n\n* dry cough lasting longer than a week\n\n* chills\n\n* shortness of breath\n\n* chest pain\n\n* reduced appetite\n\nViruses and bacteria, likeStreptococcus pneumoniaeorHaemophilus influenzae, often cause pneumonia. However, in walking pneumonia, the bacteriaMycoplasma pneumoniaemost commonly causes the condition.\n\nLearn more about pneumonia during pregancy (maternal pneumonia).",
        "## Pneumonia stages\n\nPneumonia may be classified based off the area of the lungs it’s affecting:\n\nBronchopneumoniacan affect areas throughout both of your lungs. It’s often localized close to or around your bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from your windpipe to your lungs.\n\nLobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of your lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung.\n\nLobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it’s progressed:\n\n* Congestion.Lung tissue appears heavy and congested. Fluid filled with infectious organisms has accumulated in the air sacs.\n\n* Red hepatization.Red bloods cells and immune cells have entered into the fluid. This makes the lungs appear red and solid in appearance.\n\n* Gray hepatization.The red blood cells have begun to break down while immune cells remain. The breakdown of red blood cells causes a change in color, from red to gray.\n\n* Resolution.Immune cells have begun to clear the infection. A productive cough helps eject remaining fluid from the lungs.",
        "## Symptoms of pneumonia\n\nPneumonia symptoms can be mild to life threatening. They can include:\n\n* coughingthat may producephlegm(mucus)\n\n* fever\n\n* sweating orchills\n\n* shortness of breaththat happens while doing normal activities, or even while resting\n\n* chest painthat’s worse when you breathe or cough\n\n* feelings of tiredness or fatigue\n\n* loss of appetite\n\n* nausea or vomiting\n\n* headaches\n\nOther symptoms can vary according to your age and general health:\n\n* Infants may appear to have no symptoms, but sometimes they may vomit, lack energy, or have trouble drinking or eating.\n\n* Children under 5 years old may have fast breathing or wheezing.\n\n* Older adults may have milder symptoms. They can also experience confusion or a lower-than-normal body temperature.",
        "## Causes of pneumonia\n\nPneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.\n\nSeveral types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.",
        "### Bacterial pneumonia\n\nThe most common cause ofbacterial pneumoniaisStreptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:\n\n* Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n\n* Haemophilus influenzae\n\n* Legionella pneumophila",
        "### Viral pneumonia\n\nRespiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include:\n\n* influenza (flu)\n\n* respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\n\n* rhinoviruses(common cold)\n\n* humanparainfluenzavirus (HPIV) infection\n\n* human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection\n\n* measles\n\n* chickenpox(varicella-zoster virus)\n\n* adenovirusinfection\n\n* coronavirus infection\n\n* SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19)\n\nAlthough the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar,viral pneumoniais usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment.\n\nAccording to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.",
        "### Fungal pneumonia\n\nFungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people withweakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:\n\n* Pneumocystis jirovecii\n\n* Cryptococcusspecies\n\n* Histoplasmosisspecies\n\n* Coccidioidesspecies",
        "### Risk factors\n\nAnyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include:\n\n* infants from birth to 2 years old\n\n* people ages 65 and older\n\n* people with weakened immune systems due to:pregnancyHIVthe use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs\n\n* pregnancy\n\n* HIV\n\n* the use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs\n\n* people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as:asthmacystic fibrosisdiabetesCOPDheart failuresickle cell diseaseliver diseasekidney disease\n\n* asthma\n\n* cystic fibrosis\n\n* diabetes\n\n* COPD\n\n* heart failure\n\n* sickle cell disease\n\n* liver disease\n\n* kidney disease\n\n* people who’ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator\n\n* people who’ve had a brain disorder, which can affect the ability to swallow or cough, such as:strokehead injurydementiaParkinson’s disease\n\n* stroke\n\n* head injury\n\n* dementia\n\n* Parkinson’s disease\n\n* people who’ve been regularly exposed to lung irritants, such as air pollution and toxic fumes, especially on the job\n\n* people who live in a crowded living environment, such as a prison or nursing home\n\n* people who smoke, which makes it more difficult for the body to get rid of mucus in the airways\n\n* people who use drugs or drink heavy amounts of alcohol, which weakens the immune system and increases the odds of inhaling saliva or vomit into the lungs due to sedation",
        "## Diagnosng pneumonia\n\nYour doctor will start by taking your medical history. They’ll ask you questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general.\n\nThey’ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such ascrackling.\n\nDepending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk of complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests:",
        "### Chest X-ray\n\nAnX-rayhelps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its location and extent.",
        "### Blood culture\n\nThis test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition.",
        "### Sputum culture\n\nDuring asputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after you’ve coughed deeply. It’s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection.",
        "### Pulse oximetry\n\nApulse oximetrymeasures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your bloodstream.",
        "### Fluid sample\n\nIf your doctor suspects there’sfluid in the pleural spaceof your chest, they may take afluid sampleusing a needle placed between your ribs. This test can help identify the cause of your infection.",
        "### Bronchoscopy\n\nAbronchoscopylooks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that’s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs.\n\nYour doctor may do this test if your initial symptoms are severe, or if you’re hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics.\n\nIf you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.",
        "## Treating pneumonia\n\nYour treatment will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.",
        "### Prescription medications\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a medication to help treat your pneumonia. What you’re prescribed will depend on the specific cause of your pneumonia.\n\nOralantibioticscan treat most cases of bacterial pneumonia. Always take your entire course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better. Not doing so can prevent the infection from clearing, and it may be harder to treat in the future.\n\nAntibiotic medications don’t work on viruses. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral. However, many cases of viral pneumonia clear on their own with at-home care.\n\nAntifungal medications are used to treat fungal pneumonia. You may have to take this medication for several weeks to clear the infection.",
        "### OTC medications\n\nYour doctor may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve your pain and fever, as needed. These may include:\n\n* aspirin\n\n* ibuprofen(Advil, Motrin)\n\n* acetaminophen(Tylenol)\n\nYour doctor may also recommend cough medicine to calm your cough so you can rest. Keep in mind coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs, so you don’t want to eliminate it entirely.",
        "### Home remedies\n\nAlthough home remedies don’t actually treat pneumonia, there are some things you can do to help ease symptoms.\n\nCoughing is one of the most common symptoms of pneumonia. Natural ways to relieve a cough include gargling salt water or drinking peppermint tea.\n\nCool compresses can work to relieve a fever. Drinking warm water or having a nice warm bowl of soup can help with chills.Here are more home remedies to try.\n\nYou can help your recovery and prevent a recurrence by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids.\n\nAlthough home remedies can help ease symptoms, it’s important to stick to your treatment plan. Take any prescribed medications as directed.",
        "### Hospitalization\n\nIf your symptoms are very severe or you have other health problems, you may need to be hospitalized. At the hospital, doctors can keep track of your heart rate, temperature, and breathing. Hospital treatment may include:\n\n* antibiotics injected into a vein\n\n* respiratory therapy, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs, or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation\n\n* oxygen therapyto maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity)",
        "## Complications of pneumonia\n\nPneumonia may cause complications, especially in people withweakened immune systemsor chronic conditions, such asdiabetes.\n\nComplications may include:\n\n* Worsened chronic conditions.If you have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse. These conditions includecongestive heart failureandemphysema. For certain people, pneumonia increases their risk of having aheart attack.\n\n* Bacteremia.Bacteria from the pneumonia infectionmay spread to your bloodstream. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure,septic shock, and, in some cases, organ failure.\n\n* Lung abscesses.These are cavities in the lungs that contain pus. Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to remove the pus.\n\n* Impaired breathing.You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. You may need to use a ventilator.\n\n* Acute respiratory distress syndrome.This is a severe form of respiratory failure. It’s a medical emergency.\n\n* Pleural effusion.If your pneumonia isn’t treated, you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura, calledpleural effusion. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of your lungs and the inside of your rib cage. The fluid may become infected and need to be drained.\n\n* Kidney, heart, and liver damage.These organs may be damaged if they don’t receive enough oxygen, or if there’s an overreaction of the immune system to the infection.\n\n* Death.In some cases, pneumoniacan be fatal. According to the CDC,nearly 44,000 peoplein the United States died from pneumonia in 2019.",
        "### Vaccination\n\nThe first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.\n\nThese two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia andmeningitiscaused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you.\n\nPrevnar 13is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. TheCDCrecommends this vaccine for:\n\n* children under age 2\n\n* people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia\n\n* adults ages 65 and older, on the recommendation of their doctor\n\nPneumovax 23is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. TheCDCrecommends it for:\n\n* adults ages 65 and older\n\n* adults ages 19 to 64 who smoke\n\n* people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia\n\nPneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annualflu shot. TheCDCrecommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk of flu complications.\n\nCOVID-19 can lead to pneumonia. TheCDCrecommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis vaccine protects againstHaemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. TheCDCrecommends this vaccine for:\n\n* all children under 5 years old\n\n* unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions\n\n* people who’ve gotten a bone marrow transplant\n\nAccording to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, pneumonia vaccines won’t prevent all cases of the condition.\n\nBut if you’re vaccinated, you’re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk of complications.",
        "### Other prevention tips\n\nIn addition to vaccination, there are other things you can do to avoid pneumonia:\n\n* If you smoke, try toquit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia.\n\n* Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\n* Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues.\n\n* Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enoughrest, eat abalanced diet, and getregular exercise.\n\nTogether with vaccination and additional prevention steps, you can help reduce your risk of getting pneumonia.Here are even more prevention tips.",
        "## Is pneumonia curable?\n\nA variety of infectious agents cause pneumonia. With proper recognition and treatment, many cases of pneumonia can be cleared without complications.\n\nFor bacterial infections, stopping your antibiotics early can cause the infection to not clear completely. This means your pneumonia could come back.\n\nStopping antibiotics early can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant infections are more difficult to treat.\n\nViral pneumonia often resolves in 1 to 3 weeks with at-home treatment. In some cases, you may need antivirals.\n\nAntifungal medications treat fungal pneumonia. It may require a longer period of treatment.\n\nPneumonia can become dangerous quickly, particularly in young children.Here’s how to avoid complications.",
        "## Outlook\n\nMost people respond to treatment and recover from pneumonia. Like your treatment, your recovery time will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health.\n\nA younger person may feel back to normal in a week after treatment. Others may take longer to recover and may have lingering fatigue. If your symptoms are severe, your recovery may take several weeks.\n\nConsider taking these steps to aid in your recovery and help prevent complications from occurring:\n\n* Stick to the treatment plan your doctor has developed, and take all medications as instructed.\n\n* Make sure to get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection.\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids.\n\n* Ask your doctor when you should schedule a follow-up appointment. They may want to perform another chest X-ray to make sure your infection has cleared.",
        "## Summary\n\nPneumonia is a lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The immune system’s reaction to this infection causes the lung’s air sacs to fill with pus and fluids. This leads to symptoms such as trouble breathing, a cough with or without mucus, fever, and chills.\n\nTo diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will do a physical exam and discuss your medical history. They may recommend further testing, such as a chest X-ray.\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the infection. It may involve antibiotics, antiviral medication, or antifungal medication.\n\nPneumonia often clears up in a few weeks. See a doctor right away if your symptoms get worse, as you may need to be hospitalized to prevent or treat more serious complications.",

        "# Everything You Need to Know About Chlamydia Infection\n\nChlamydia is an STI that’s not always accompanied by symptoms. However, if left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious complications.",
        "## What is chlamydia?\n\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. People who have chlamydia often don’t have outward symptoms in the early stages.\n\nIn fact, it’s estimated that40 to 96 percentof people with chlamydia have no symptoms. But chlamydia can still cause health problems later.\n\nUntreated chlamydia can cause serious complications, so it’s important to get regular screenings and talk with your doctor or another healthcare professional if you have any concerns.\n\nSymptoms of chlamydia may be similar to symptoms of other STIs.See photos of symptoms caused by different STIs to understand the visible effects these infections can have.",
        "### How is chlamydia transmitted?\n\nSex without acondomor other barrier method and oral sex without a barrier method are themain waysa chlamydia infection can be transmitted.\n\nPenetration doesn’t have to occur to contract it. Touching genitals together may transmit the bacteria. It can also be contracted during anal sex.\n\nNewborn babies can acquire chlamydia from theirmotherduring birth. Mostprenatal testingincludes a chlamydia test, but it doesn’t hurt to double-check with an OB-GYN during thefirst prenatal checkup.\n\nAchlamydia infection in the eyecan occur through oral or genital contact with the eyes, but this isn’t common.\n\nChlamydia can also be contracted even in someone who’s had the infection once before and successfully treated it.Find out more about how chlamydia is transmitted between people.",
        "## Symptoms\n\nChlamydia is often referred to as a “silent infection” because most people with a chlamydia infection don’t experience any symptoms.\n\nHowever, it cancauseseveral symptoms in others, including:\n\n* pain\n\n* a burning sensation while urinating\n\n* abnormal discharge from the penis or vagina\n\nSome symptoms of chlamydia may also differ slightly for men and women.",
        "### Chlamydia symptoms in men\n\nMany men don’t notice the symptoms of chlamydia. Most men have no symptoms at all.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms of chlamydia in men include:\n\n* burning sensation during urination\n\n* yellow or green discharge from the penis\n\n* pain in the lower abdomen\n\n* pain in the testicles\n\nIt’s also possible to get a chlamydia infection in the anus. In this case, the main symptoms are often:\n\n* discharge\n\n* pain\n\n* bleeding from this area\n\nHaving oral sex with someone who has the infection raises the risk of getting chlamydia in the throat. Symptoms can include asore throat,cough, or fever. It’s also possible to carry bacteria in the throat and not know it.",
        "### Chlamydia symptoms in women\n\nChlamydia is often known as the “silent infection.” That’s because people with chlamydia may not experience symptoms at all.\n\nIf a woman contracts the STI, it may take several weeks before any symptoms appear.\n\nSome of the most common symptoms of chlamydia in women include:\n\n* painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)\n\n* vaginal discharge\n\n* burning sensation during urination\n\n* pain in the lower abdomen\n\n* inflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)\n\n* bleeding between periods\n\nIn some women, the infection can spread to thefallopian tubes, which may cause a condition calledpelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is a medical emergency.\n\nThe symptoms of PID are:\n\n* fever\n\n* severe pelvic pain\n\n* nausea\n\n* abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods\n\nChlamydia can also infect the rectum. Women may not experience symptoms if they have a chlamydia infection in the rectum. If symptoms of a rectal infection do occur, however, they may include rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding.\n\nAdditionally, women can develop a throat infection if they have oral sex with someone with the infection. Though it’s possible to contract it without knowing it, symptoms of achlamydia infection in your throatinclude cough, fever, and sore throat.\n\nThe symptoms of STIs inmenandwomencan be different, so it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional if you experience any of the above symptoms.",
        "## Causes and risk factors\n\nChlamydia is an STI caused by a specific strain of bacteria known asChlamydia trachomatis.\n\nIt is transmitted through vaginal discharge or semen, and can be transmitted through genital contact or oral, vaginal, or anal sex without a barrier method, like a condom.\n\nChlamydia is more common in women than in men. In fact, it’s estimated that the overall rate of infection istwo times higherfor women than men in the United States.\n\nSome of the other risk factors for infection include:\n\n* not using barrier methods like condoms consistently with new sexual partners\n\n* having a sexual partner who is having sex with other people\n\n* having a history of chlamydia or other STIs",
        "### How common is chlamydia?\n\nIn 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that there were approximately4 millioncases of chlamydia in the United States.\n\nMen and women can both get the infection, but more cases in women are reported.\n\nInfection rates are highest among younger women, with the highest rates of infection occurring in women between ages 15 and 24.\n\nTheCDCrecommends that all sexually active women ages 25 and younger get screened for chlamydia every year, as well as women ages 25 and older with risk factors for chlamydia.\n\nStatistically, a person is more likely to get an STI if they’ve had sex with more than one person. Other risk factorsincludehaving had an STI in the past, or currently have an infection, because this could lower resistance.\n\nAn act of sexual assault can raise the risk for contracting chlamydia and other STIs. If you were forced into any sexual activity, including oral sex, aim to get screened as soon as possible.Organizations like theRape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN)offer support for survivors of rape or sexual assault. For anonymous, confidential help:\n\n* Call RAINN’s 24/7 national sexual assault hotline at 800-656-4673\n\n* Find a local service providerfor screenings\n\n* Chat 24/7 on their online sexual assault hotline atonline.rainn.org\n\nRates for chlamydia and other STIs have been climbing in recent years.See the new statistics and groups that are most at risk.",
        "### How can I reduce my risk of getting chlamydia?\n\nAbstaining from sexual activityis the only guaranteed way to prevent chlamydia.\n\nHowever, if you are sexually active, there are several simple steps you can take to decrease your risk of contracting chlamydia, as well as many other STIs.\n\nHere are a few ways toreduceyour risk:\n\n* Use barrier methods.Using a condom,dental dam, or other barrier method each time you have oral, vaginal, or anal sex can help significantly decrease the risk of infection.\n\n* Get tested.Getting screened regularly for STIs can help prevent the transmission of chlamydia and ensure that you get treatment if needed. A doctor can help determine how often you should get tested, depending on your risk level.\n\n* Communicate with your sexual partners.Having multiple sexual partners can increase your risk of chlamydia and other STIs. But you can decrease this risk by openly discussing STI prevention and using barrier methods every time you have sex.\n\n* Avoid sharing sex toys.If you do decide to share any sex toys, wash them thoroughly between each use and cover with a condom.",
        "## Chlamydia treatment\n\nChlamydia is easy to treat and can be cured. Since it’s bacterial in nature, antibiotics treat it.\n\nAzithromycinis an antibiotic usually prescribed in a single, large dose.Doxycyclineis an antibiotic that must be taken twice per day for about 1 week.\n\nA healthcare professional may also prescribe other antibiotics. No matter which antibiotic is prescribed, dosage instructions should be followed carefully to make sure the infection clears up fully. This can take up to 2 weeks, even with the single-dose medications.\n\nDuring the treatment time, it’s important not to have sex. It’s still possible to transmit and contract chlamydia if exposed again, even if you’ve treated a previous infection.",
        "## Chlamydia in throat\n\nSTIs can also be transmitted and contracted during oral sex. Contact with the mouth, lips, or tongue may be enough totransmitchlamydia.\n\nIf you contract chlamydia from oral sex, you may experience no symptoms. Like vaginal or anal chlamydia infections, symptoms don’t always appear.\n\nIf symptoms are present with chlamydia in the throat, they can include:\n\n* sore throat\n\n* dry throat\n\n* fever\n\n* coughing\n\nOther STIs can develop in the throat.Each type of STI in the throat causes unique symptoms and concerns.\n\nAlthoughchlamydia is curable, it’s still important to stay protected and prevent recurrence.",
        "## Home remedies for chlamydia\n\nChlamydia is caused by a bacterial infection. The only true cure for this type of infection is antibiotics.\n\nSome alternative treatments may helpeasesymptoms. It’s important to remember that untreated chlamydia can lead to long-term complications, including fertility problems and chronic inflammation.\n\nHome remedies for chlamydia that may be effective (for symptoms, not the infection itself) include:\n\n* Goldenseal.This medicinal plant may limit symptoms during an infection by reducing inflammation.\n\n* Echinacea.This plant has been widely used toboostthe immune system to help people overcome infections of many types, from the common cold to skin wounds. It may help reduce symptoms of chlamydia.\n\nAlthough compounds in these plants might help ease inflammation and infection in general, there aren’t any quality studies thatshowthey’re effective specifically for chlamydia symptoms.",
        "## Diagnosis\n\nWhen seeing a healthcare professional about chlamydia, they’ll likely ask about symptoms. If there are none, they may ask why you have concerns.\n\nIf symptoms are present, the healthcare professional may perform aphysical exam. This lets them observe any discharge, sores, or unusual spots that may be related to a possible infection.\n\nThe most effectivediagnostic testfor chlamydia is to swab the vagina in women and to test urine in men. If there’s a chance the infection is in the anus or throat, these areas may be swabbed as well.\n\nResults may take several days. The doctor’s office should call to discuss results. If the test returns positive, a follow-up appointment and treatment options will be discussed.\n\nIf you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.",
        "## Chlamydia untreated\n\nIf a healthcare professional is seen as soon as chlamydia is suspected, the infection will likely clear up with no lasting problems.\n\nHowever, people may experience serious medical issues if they wait too long to treat it.",
        "### Female complications of untreated chlamydia\n\nSome women develop PID, an infection that can damage theuterus,cervix, andovaries. PID is a painful disease that often requires hospital treatment.\n\nInfertility is also possible if chlamydia is left untreated because the fallopian tubes may become scarred.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the infection canpassto babies during birth, which can causeeye infectionsandpneumoniain newborns.",
        "### Male complications of untreated chlamydia\n\nMen can also experience complications when chlamydia is left untreated. Theepididymis— the tube that holds the testicles in place — may become inflamed, causing pain. This is known asepididymitis.\n\nThe infection can also spread to theprostate gland, causing a fever, painful intercourse, and discomfort in the lower back. Another possible complication ismale chlamydial urethritis.\n\nThese are just some of the most common complications of untreated chlamydia, which is why it’s important to get medical attention right away. Most people who get treatment quickly have no long-term medical problems.",
        "## Chlamydia in eye\n\nA chlamydia infection is most common in the genital area, but it can occur in less common places like the anus, throat, and the eyes. It can occur in the eyes through direct or indirect contact with the bacteria.\n\nFor example, the infection can go from the genitals to the eye if you touch your eye without washing your hands.\n\nIf you have a chlamydia eye infection, also known as chlamydial conjunctivitis, the following symptoms may occur:\n\n* redness\n\n* swelling\n\n* itching\n\n* irritation\n\n* mucus or discharge\n\n* sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n\nIf left untreated, chlamydia in the eye canleadto blindness. But it’s easily treated, and early treatment will help cure the infection and prevent complications.\n\nChlamydia in the eye may be confused with more common eye infections.Learn the differences between chlamydia and other eye infections to know the symptoms.",
        "## Chlamydia and gonorrhea\n\nChlamydia andgonorrheaare two common STIs. Both are caused by bacteria that can be transmitted during vaginal, oral, or anal sex without a barrier method.\n\nBoth STIs are unlikely to cause symptoms. If symptoms do occur, people with chlamydia experience their first symptoms within a few weeks of contracting the infection. With gonorrhea, it can be much longer before symptoms appear, if at all.\n\nBoth infections share some similar symptoms. These include:\n\n* pain orburning during urination\n\n* an abnormaldischargefrom the penis, vagina, or anus\n\n* swelling in the testicles orscrotum\n\n* rectal pain\n\n* bleeding from the rectum\n\nThe two infections can also lead to PID and reproductive issues if left untreated.\n\nUntreated gonorrhea can lead to itching, soreness, and pain in the rectum, such as during bowel movements. Women with untreated gonorrhea may also experience prolonged,heavy periodsand pain during intercourse.\n\nAntibiotics can effectively treat both chlamydia and gonorrhea. They’re both curable and unlikely to cause long-term issues when treated quickly.",
        "## Chlamydia prevention\n\nThe surest way for a sexually active person to avoid contracting chlamydia is to use a condom or other barrier method during sexual intercourse.\n\nIt’s recommended to:\n\n* Use a barrier method with every new sexual partner.\n\n* Get tested regularlyfor STIs with new partners.\n\n* Avoid having oral sex, or use protection during oral sex, until you and a new partner have been screened for STIs.\n\nFollowing these steps can help people avoid infections, unintended pregnancy, and other complications.STI prevention is incredibly successful if done correctly.",
        "### When can I have sex again?\n\nIf you were diagnosed with chlamydia, wait to have sex again until you havefinishedyour treatment.\n\nFor some antibiotics, such as doxycycline, this means may need to wait 1 week to have sex, or until you have completed your prescribed course of treatment.\n\nIf you were prescribed a single dose of medication, like azithromycin, wait 7 days after taking the medication before having sex.",
        "### Can I test myself for chlamydia at home?\n\nHome testing kits for chlamydiaare widely available and can be purchased at many pharmacies or online.\n\nThese kits typically require a urine sample or tissue swab, which you can collect at home and securely ship back to the lab to receive your results.\n\nSome companies also include a free medical consultation with a doctor if your test results are positive to review your treatment options.",
        "### Does chlamydia have a smell?\n\nIn some cases, chlamydia cancauseunusual vaginal discharge, which could have a strong or pungent smell.\n\nHowever, this could also be a sign of several other STIs, includingbacterial vaginosisortrichomoniasis. It could also be caused by many other factors,includingsweat, changes in pH, or shifts in hormone levels.\n\nConsider talking with a healthcare professional to address any concerns regarding abnormal discharge or odor, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms like pain, bleeding, itching, or burning.",
        "### Can chlamydia turn into something else?\n\nIf left untreated for long periods of time, chlamydia can cause several complications.\n\nIn women, untreated chlamydia can lead to PID, a condition that couldcausepermanent damage to the reproductive system as well as infertility.\n\nIn men, chlamydia could cause multiple complications if left untreated,includingepididymitis,prostatitis, or male chlamydial urethritis.",

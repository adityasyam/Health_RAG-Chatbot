        "## What’s prostate cancer?\n\nProstate cancer is themost commonlydiagnosed cancer in males worldwide. In the United States, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that268,490men will be newly diagnosed with this condition in 2022.\n\nTheprostateis a small gland found in a man’s lower abdomen, located under the bladder and surrounding the urethra. The hormonetestosteroneregulates the prostate. In addition, the prostate gland produces seminal fluid, also known assemen. Semen is the substance containing sperm that exits the urethra during ejaculation.\n\nWhen an abnormal, malignant growth of cells — which is called a tumor — forms in the prostate, it’s called prostate cancer. This cancer can spread to other areas of the body. In these cases, because the cancer is made of cells from the prostate, it’s still called prostate cancer.",
        "## Types of prostate cancer\n\nAlmost all cases of prostate cancer are a type of cancer calledadenocarcinomathat grows in the tissue of a gland, such as the prostate gland. However, other raretypes of cancercan also originate in the prostate, including:\n\n* small cell carcinoma, such aslung cancer\n\n* neuroendocrine tumors, such aspancreatic cancer\n\n* transitional cell carcinomas, such askidney cancer\n\n* sarcomas, such as bone cell cancer\n\nProstate cancer is also categorized by how fast it grows. It has two types of growth:\n\n* aggressive, or fast-growing\n\n* nonaggressive, or slow-growing\n\nWith nonaggressive prostate cancer, the tumor grows slowly. However, with aggressive cancer, the tumor can overgrow and spread to other body areas, such as the bones, and becomes ametastatic cancer.",
        "## Prostate cancer causes and risk factors\n\nThere’s no known cause for prostate cancer, but risk factors such as family history or age may increase your likelihood of developing themalignancy.",
        "### Who’s at risk?\n\nWhile prostate cancer could occur in any man, certain factors raise your risk for the disease. Theserisk factorsinclude:\n\n* older age, 50 years of age or older\n\n* a family history of prostate cancer\n\n* certain ethnicities or race — for instance,African American malesare at greater risk of having prostate cancer\n\n* obesity\n\n* genetic changes\n\nSomestudiesconsider other risk factors like diet and chemical exposure that may increase your diagnosis chances. However, the ACS says those effects are still unclear. Prostate cancer is also rare in men under the age of 40.",
        "## Prostate cancer symptoms\n\nSome forms of prostate cancer are nonaggressive, so you may not have any symptoms. However, advanced prostate cancer often causes symptoms.\n\nIf you have any of the following signs or symptoms, don’t hesitate to call your doctor. In addition, other conditions can cause some symptoms of prostate cancer, such asbenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), so you’ll need to check with your doctor to get a proper diagnosis.\n\nSymptomsof prostate cancer can include urinary problems, sexual problems, and pain and numbness.",
        "### Urinary problems\n\nUrinary problems are common because the prostate is located beneath the bladder and surrounds the urethra. Because of this location, if a tumor grows on the prostate, it could press on the bladder or urethra and cause problems.\n\nUrinary problems can include:\n\n* frequent need tourinate\n\n* a stream that’s slower or weaker than normal\n\n* bleeding while urinating",
        "### Sexual problems\n\nErectile dysfunctionmay be a symptom of prostate cancer. Also calledimpotence, this condition makes you unable to get and keep an erection.\n\nBlood in the semenafter ejaculation can also be a symptom of prostate cancer.",
        "### Pain and numbness\n\nYou may experienceweaknessornumbnessin the legs and feet. You may also lose control of your bladder and bowel if cancer has spread, causingpressure on your spinal cord.",
        "## Early detection of prostate cancer\n\nOne of the best ways to detect cancer before any symptoms appear is to undergo a screening test. The earlier you find cancer, the easier it may be to treat.",
        "### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)\n\nPSAis a blood test that measures the number of prostate proteins in your blood. If the level is high, it may indicate prostate cancer.\n\nThe PSA test is a useful tool for your doctor to consider whether or not your PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer. Since early detection is crucial for treating cancer, this is a major benefit. The test is relatively simple and widely available for people with a prostate that want to be screened.\n\nHowever, there are pros and cons to screening. For example, a2018 studyfound that PSA may increase your chances of early detection, but it doesn’t lessen your chances of dying from prostate cancer. The test has some associated concerns and it is important to discuss with your doctor what the risks of PSA screening would mean for you.\n\nOtherconcernsto consider about PSA include:\n\n* accuracy level\n\n* overdiagnosis and overtreatment tendencies\n\n* unclear overall benefit\n\nOtherfactorscan increase your PSA level, such as:\n\n* enlarged prostate\n\n* older age\n\n* ejaculation\n\n* prostate infectionor inflammation\n\n* specific medications",
        "### Digital rectal exam (DRE)\n\nWhen you undergo aDRE, the doctor places their lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel any bumps, rigid, or enlarged areas of the prostate.\n\nSince prostate cancer often starts at the back of the gland, it may be detected using this method. Although not as effective as a PSA test, it is more effective among men who have an average PSA level but still have prostate cancer.",
        "### Prostate imaging\n\nUsing advanced imaging, such asMRIorultrasound, you can detect prostate cancer. In a2018 research article, experts indicated that you can now catch it earlier — and better identify its stage — with improved technologies.",
        "### Prostate biopsy\n\nSometimes, your doctor may recommend aprostate biopsyif they suspect cancer from an exam or find that you have an elevated PSA level.\n\nDuring the biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of your prostate tissue to analyze the cells. If they find the cells are cancerous, it can also help them determine how quickly they may spread and grow. To do this, they determine yourGleason score.\n\nThe Gleason score is an effective tool to predict your outlook, but it isn’t absolute. There are manyother factorsinvolved when predicting the spread and course of the disease, with experts varying in how they use the scoring system.\n\nTo be sure, the best way to determine your outlook depends on other predictors in addition to your Gleason scores, like your physical exam and tumor imaging.",
        "### Gleason score\n\nYou’ll receive a Gleason score if you’ve had a prostate biopsy. Pathologists use this score to classify the grade of prostate cancer cells. The grade means how many abnormal cells look like cancer and how aggressive their growth seems.\n\nA Gleason score lower than 6 means your cells don’t show signs of cancer, so your risk is low. If your score is 7 or higher, your doctor will likely look at your score and your PSA level to assess the cells.\n\nFor instance, a Gleason score of 7, with a PSA level between 10 to 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), means they’ve identified cancer cells — but the cancer is likely nonaggressive, with slow-growing cells.\n\nA Gleason score of 8 or higher indicates a more advanced tumor with PSA levels greater than 20 ng/mL. That means your risk of aggressive cancer is higher.",
        "## Prostate cancer screening by age\n\nTheACSdoes have screening recommendations for men as they get older.\n\nFirst, they recommend that doctors talk to men about the pros and cons of screening prostate cancer during an annual exam. These conversations should occur for the following ages:\n\n* Age 40:For men at very high risk, such as those with more than one first-degree relative — a father, brother, or son — who had prostate cancer at an age younger than 65.\n\n* Age 45:For men at high risk, such as African American men and men with a first-degree relative diagnosed at an age younger than 65.\n\n* Age 50:For men at average risk of prostate cancer, and who are expected to live at least 10 more years.\n\nBefore you decide to undergo screening, consider all the information available, including uncertainties, risks, and benefits of prostate cancer screening. Then, you and your doctor can decide which test is best for you, if any.",
        "## Prostate cancer stages\n\nYour doctor can discuss how far cancer has spread by using a staging system.\n\nTheAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TMN staging systemstages prostate cancer. Like many other types of cancer, the system stages it by:\n\n* the size or extent of thetumor\n\n* lymph node involvement\n\n* whether or not cancer has spread (metastasized) to other sites or organs\n\n* PSA level at the time of diagnosis\n\n* Gleason score\n\nProstatecancer stagesrange from 1 to 4. However, the disease is most advanced in stage 4.",
        "## Prostate cancer treatment\n\nYour doctor will develop an appropriate treatment plan for your cancer based on your age, health status, and the stage of your cancer.",
        "### Nonaggressive\n\nIf the cancer is nonaggressive, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting, also called active surveillance. This means you’ll delay treatment but have regular checkups with your doctor to monitor cancer.\n\nIf your doctor chooses to monitor cancer using active surveillance, they check your PSA every 6 months and perform an annual DRE. In addition, they may do a repeat biopsy and imaging in 1 to 3 years after initial diagnosis.\n\nThe doctor actively monitors your symptoms alone to decide if treatment is needed when simply observing the disease.",
        "### Aggressive\n\nDoctors may treat more aggressive types of cancer with other options, such as:\n\n* surgery\n\n* radiation\n\n* cryotherapy\n\n* hormone therapy\n\n* chemotherapy\n\n* stereotactic radiosurgery\n\n* immunotherapy\n\nIf your cancer is very aggressive and has metastasized, there’s a good chance it has spread to your bones. Forbone metastases, the above treatments may be used, in addition to others.",
        "### Treatment based on risk\n\nIf your prostate cancer has yet to spread, stage 1-3, doctors use risk groups to plan your treatment. However, advanced stages can lead to more or less treatment. Other factors may also come into play, such as your age and overall health. Note that chemotherapy is used after hormonal therapy is not working for treatment.",
        "## Prostatectomy\n\nA prostatectomy is a surgical procedure removing part or all of your prostate gland. For example, if you have prostate cancer that hasn’t spread outside of the prostate, your doctor may suggest that you have a radical prostatectomy, which removes the entire prostate.\n\nThere are different types of radical prostatectomies. Some are open, which means you’ll have a larger incision in your lower abdomen. Others are laparoscopic, which means you’ll have several smaller incisions in your stomach.",
        "## Outlook\n\nThe outlook is usually good if prostate cancer is diagnosed early and hasn’t spread from the original tumor. Early detection and treatment are critical to a positive outcome. If you think you have symptoms of prostate cancer, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor right away.\n\nHowever, if the cancer advances and spreads outside of your prostate, that will affect your outlook.",
        "## Prostate cancer prevention\n\nThere are certainrisk factorsfor prostate cancer, such as age and family history, that you can’t control. However, there are others you can manage.\n\nFor example,quitting smokingcould reduce your risk of prostate cancer. Diet and exercise are also essential factors that can influence your risk of prostate cancer.",
        "### Diet\n\nCertain foods may help reduce your risk of prostate cancer, such as a diet low in dairy and calcium. Some foods that could lower your risk of prostate cancer include:\n\n* cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale\n\n* fish\n\n* soy\n\n* oils that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such as olive oil",
        "### Exercise\n\nExercise can likely help reduce your risk of developing advanced prostate cancer and dying of prostate cancer.\n\nExercise can also help you lose weight, and it’s vital because2016 researchhas shown obesity as a risk factor for prostate cancer. With your doctor’s approval, aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.",
        "## Talk with your doctor\n\nProstate cancer is a risk for all men as they age, but if it’s caught and treated early, the outlook is generally very good. So as you get older, be sure to have open conversations with your doctor about your risk.\n\nIf you have any symptoms you think might be prostate cancer, talk to your doctor right away. And even if you don’t have symptoms, consider adopting a healthy lifestyle to decrease your risk.",

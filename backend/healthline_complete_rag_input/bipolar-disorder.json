        "# Everything You Need to Know About Bipolar Disorder\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging to manage, many effective treatments and strategies are available.\n\nBipolar disorder isn’t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that2.8%of U.S. adults — or about 5 million people — have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.\n\nThe condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.\n\nKey symptoms of bipolar disorder include:\n\n* episodes ofmania, or extremely elevated mood\n\n* episodes ofdepression, or low mood\n\nThese episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.\n\nIf you’re living with bipolar disorder, the following treatment options can help you learn to manage mood episodes, which can improve not only your symptoms but also your overall quality of life.",
        "## Types of bipolar disorder\n\nThere are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.",
        "### Bipolar I\n\nBipolar Iis defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes, or major depressive periods before and after the manic episode. A person can also go through a long period of stable mood before experiencing either mania or depression.\n\nThis type of bipolar disorder affects people of all sexes equally.",
        "### Are sex and gender the same thing?\n\nPeople often use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, but they have different meanings:\n\n* “Sex” refers to the physical characteristics that differentiate male, female, and intersex bodies.\n\n* “Gender” refers to a person’s identity and how they feel inside. Examples include man, woman, nonbinary, agender, bigender, genderfluid, pangender, and trans. A person’s gender identity may differ from the sex they were assigned at birth.",
        "### Bipolar II\n\nPeople with bipolar II experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 hypomanic episode that lasts about 4 days. According to a2017 review, this type of bipolar disorder may be more common in females.",
        "### Cyclothymia\n\nPeople withcyclothymiaexperience some symptoms ofhypomaniaand depression, but not enough to characterize an episode of hypomania ordepression.\n\nThese episodes also involve symptoms that are shorter and less severe than the episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition experienceno mood symptomsfor1 to 2 monthsat a time.\n\nYour doctor can explain more about what kind of bipolar disorder you have when discussing your diagnosis.\n\nSome people experience distinct mood symptoms that resemble but don’t align with these three types. If that’s the case for you, you might get a diagnosis of:\n\n* other specified bipolar and related disorders\n\n* unspecified bipolar and related disorders\n\nLearn more about the types of bipolar disorder.",
        "## Bipolar disorder symptoms\n\nTo receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or hypomania.\n\nThese both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania symptoms typically don’t cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.\n\nSome people living with bipolar disorder also experiencemajor depressive episodesor “down” moods.\n\nThese three main symptoms — mania, hypomania, and depression — are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.",
        "### Bipolar I symptoms\n\nAccording to theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:\n\n* at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week\n\n* symptoms that affect daily function\n\n* symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use\n\nYou could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known asmixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it’s worth reaching out for professional support as soon as possible.\n\nWhile you don’t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.",
        "### Bipolar II symptoms\n\nA diagnosis of bipolar II requires:\n\n* at least one episode of hypomania that lasts4 days or longerand involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania\n\n* hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life\n\n* at least one episode of major depression that lasts2 weeks or longer\n\n* at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life\n\n* symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use\n\nBipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you’ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously.\n\nWith bipolar II, though, you won’t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you’ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.",
        "### Cyclothymia symptoms\n\nA diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:\n\n* periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over2 years or longer(1 yearfor children and adolescents)\n\n* symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression\n\n* symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time\n\n* symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use\n\n* symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life\n\nFluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you’ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms.\n\nHypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don’t qualify for a major depressive episode.\n\nIf youdoexperience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending on your symptoms.",
        "## Mania and hypomania\n\nAn episode of mania often involves an emotional high. You might feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full of energy. You might also feel jumpy or notice your thoughts seem to race. Some people also experiencehallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis.\n\nManic episodes can involve behavior that’s more impulsive than usual, often because you feel invincible or untouchable. Commonly cited examples of this kind of behavior include:\n\n* having sex without using abarrier method\n\n* misusing alcohol and drugs\n\n* going on spending sprees\n\nBut impulsiveness can also show up in plenty of other ways. Maybe you:\n\n* quit your job abruptly\n\n* take off on a road trip by yourself without telling anyone\n\n* make a big investment on a whim\n\n* drive much faster than usual, well above the speed limit\n\n* participate in extreme sports you wouldn’t ordinarily consider\n\nWhile there are many reasons why a person might engage in these behaviors, the key to mania is that these are not things you would choose to engage in periods of stable mood.\n\nHypomania, generally associated with bipolar II disorder, involves many of the same symptoms, though they’re less severe. Unlike mania, hypomania oftendoesn’t leadto consequences at work, school, or in your relationships. Episodes of hypomania don’t involvepsychosis. They typically won’t last as long as episodes of mania or require inpatient care.\n\nWith hypomania, you might feel very productive and energized, but you may not notice other changes in your mood. People who don’t know you well may not, either. Those closest to you, however, will usually pick up on your shifting mood and energy levels.",
        "## Major depressive episodes\n\nA “down” change in mood can leave you feeling lethargic, unmotivated, and sad.\n\nBipolar-related episodes ofmajor depressionwill involve at least five of these symptoms:\n\n* a lasting low mood marked bydeep sadness,hopelessness, or feelings of emptiness\n\n* loss of energy\n\n* a sense of feeling slower than usual or persistent restlessness\n\n* lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed\n\n* periods oftoo little or too much sleep\n\n* a sense ofguiltor worthlessness\n\n* trouble concentrating, focusing, and making decisions\n\n* thoughts of death, dying, or suicide\n\n* changes in appetite or weight\n\nNot everyone with bipolar disorderexperiencesmajor depressive episodes, though many people do. Depending on your type of bipolar disorder, you might experience only a few symptoms of depression but not the full five needed for a major episode.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that sometimes, but not always, the euphoria of mania can feel enjoyable. Once you get treatment for mania, the symptom-free mood you experience might feel more like a “down” shift, or a period of depression, than a more typical mood state.\n\nWhile bipolar disorder can cause a depressed mood, bipolar disorder and depression have one major difference. With bipolar disorder, you might have “up” and “down” mood states. With depression, though, your mood and emotionsmight remain“down” until you get treatment.\n\nDiscover the differences between bipolar disorder and depression.",
        "## Bipolar disorder symptoms in women vs. men\n\nMost research suggests that males and females receive bipolar disorder diagnosesroughly equally, though some studiessuggestit may be more prevalent in females. However, the main symptoms of the disorder may vary, depending on the sex you were assigned at birth and your gender.\n\nFemales with bipolar disordertend to receivediagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They’re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I.\n\nAdditionally, females living with bipolar disorder tend to experience:\n\n* milder episodes of mania\n\n* more depressive episodes than manic episodes\n\n* rapid cycling, orfour or more episodesof mania and depression in 1 year\n\n* more co-occurring conditions\n\nFemales with bipolar disorder may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related tomenstruation,pregnancy, andmenopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time.\n\nGet the facts about bipolar disorder in females.\n\nMales with bipolar disorder, on the other hand, may:\n\n* get a diagnosis earlier in life\n\n* experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes\n\n* be more likely to also have asubstance use disorder\n\n* show moreaggressionduring episodes of mania",
        "## Bipolar disorder in historically marginalized groups\n\nResearchshows that people from historically marginalized groups, particularly those of African ancestry, are frequently misdiagnosed with other conditions likeschizophrenia, especially if they exhibit symptoms of psychosis.\n\nWhile the symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary somewhat from person to person and can depend on the type, there are clear criteria for diagnosis.\n\nResearch also suggests50-75%of people living with bipolar disorder will experience some symptoms of psychosis, but this is stable across all racial and ethnic groups.\n\nBoth these factors suggest that bias may play a role in this frequent misdiagnosis.",
        "## Bipolar disorder in children and teens\n\nDiagnosing bipolar disorder in children is controversial, largely because children don’t always display the same bipolar disorder symptoms as adults. Their moods and behaviors may also not follow the standards doctors use to diagnose the disorder in adults.\n\nMany bipolar disorder symptoms that occur in children also overlap with symptoms of other conditions that commonly occur in children, such asattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nHowever, in the last few decades, doctors and mental health professionals have come to recognize the condition in children. A diagnosis can help children get treatment, but reaching a diagnosis may take many weeks or months. It may be worth seeking care from a professional who specializes in treating children with mental health conditions.\n\nLike adults, children with bipolar disorder experience extreme mood shifts. Theycan appearvery happy and show signs of excitable behavior, or seem very tearful, low, and irritable.\n\nAll children experience mood changes, but bipolar disorder causes distinct and noticeable mood symptoms. Mood changes are also usually more extreme than a child’s typical change in mood.",
        "### Manic symptoms in children\n\nSymptoms of mania in children can include:\n\n* acting very silly and feeling overly happy\n\n* talking fast and rapidly changing subjects\n\n* having trouble focusing or concentrating\n\n* engaging in behaviors that can have harmful effects\n\n* having a very short temper that leads quickly to outbursts of anger\n\n* having trouble sleeping and not feeling tired after sleep loss",
        "### Depressive symptoms in children\n\nWith bipolar disorder, symptoms of depressive episodes in children can include:\n\n* moping around, acting very sad, or crying frequently\n\n* sleeping too much or too little\n\n* having little energy for usual activities or showing no signs of interest in anything\n\n* complaining about not feeling well, including having frequent headaches or stomachaches\n\n* feelings of worthlessness or guilt\n\n* eating too little or too much\n\n* thoughts of death orsuicide",
        "### Other possible diagnoses\n\nSome of the behavior issues you notice in your child could suggest other mental health conditions, such asADHDordepression. It’s also possible for children to have bipolar disorder with another condition.\n\nYour child’s doctor can offer more guidance and support with noting and tracking your child’s behaviors, which can help them find the right diagnosis.\n\nThe correct diagnosis can play a major role in finding the most effective treatment for your child. Treatment, of course, can make a big difference in your child’s symptoms, not to mention their quality of life.",
        "### Symptoms in teens\n\nShifting hormones, plus the life changes that naturally happen withpuberty, can make teens seem extremely emotional from time to time.\n\nYet drastic or rapidly fluctuating changes in mood may suggest a more serious condition, such as bipolar disorder, rather thantypical teenage development.\n\nA bipolar disorder diagnosis is most common during the late teen and early adult years.\n\nCommon symptoms of mania in teenagers include:\n\n* being very happy\n\n* “acting out” or misbehaving\n\n* taking part in behaviors that may have a harmful effect, like substance use\n\n* thinking about sex more than usual\n\n* becoming overly sexual orsexually active\n\n* having trouble sleeping, without signs of fatigue or being tired\n\n* having a very short temper\n\n* having trouble staying focused or getting distracted easily\n\nCommon symptoms of adepressive episodeinclude:\n\n* sleeping too much or too little\n\n* eating too much or too little\n\n* feeling very sad and showing little excitability\n\n* withdrawing from activities and friends\n\n* thinking or talking about death and suicide\n\nRemember that many of these signs, like experimenting with substances and thinking about sex, aren’t uncommon teenage behaviors. But if they seem part of a larger pattern of shifting moods or start to affect their day-to-day life, they could be a sign of bipolar disorder or another condition.\n\nLearn more about bipolar disorder in teenagers and how to treat it.",
        "## Bipolar disorder treatment\n\nSeveral treatmentscan help you manage bipolar disorder symptoms. Theseincludemedications, counseling, and lifestyle measures. Somenatural remediescan also have benefits.",

        "### Natural remedies for bipolar disorder\n\nSome natural remedies might also help with bipolar disorder symptoms.\n\nYou’ll always want to check with your doctor or psychiatrist before trying these remedies, though. In some cases, they could interfere with any medications you’re taking.\n\nThe following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy:\n\n* Omega-3:Some2016 researchsuggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. However, a2021 studyfound weak support for using the supplement to treat depression symptoms in bipolar disorder.\n\n* Rhodiola rosea:A2013 reviewsuggeststhis plantmay help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder, but this, too, has not been substantiated with newer research.\n\n* S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe):SAMe is an amino acid supplement that mayhelp easesymptoms of major depression and other mood disorders.

        "## Causes and risk factors\n\nBipolar disorder is a fairly common mental health condition, but experts have yet to determine why some people develop the condition.\n\nSome potential causes of bipolar disorder include:",
        "### Genetics\n\nIf your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you’re more likely to develop the condition.

        "## Can you prevent bipolar disorder?\n\nOnce you begin to experience mood episodes, youcantake steps to help reduce the severity of those episodes and lower your chances of experiencing additional mood episodes.

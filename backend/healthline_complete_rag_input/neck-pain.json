        "# Neck Pain: Symptoms, Causes, and How to Treat It\n\nNeck pain or stiffness is usually from poor posture or overuse, or an awkward sleeping position. But sometimes, it can indicate a serious injury like whiplash or an illness, so a doctor’s care may be necessary.\n\nYour neck is made up of vertebrae that extend from the skull to the upper torso.Cervical discsabsorb shock between the bones.\n\nThe bones, ligaments, and muscles of your neck support your head and allow for motion. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury can cause neck pain or stiffness.\n\nIf you have neck pain that continues for more than a week, is severe, or is accompanied by other symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.",
        "## Neck pain symptoms\n\nNeck pain symptoms canrangein severity and duration. Oftentimes, neck pain is acute and lasts for only a couple of days or weeks. Other times, it may become chronic. Your neck pain may be mild and not interfere much with your activities or daily living, or it may be severe and cause disability.\n\nSymptoms of neck pain may include:\n\n* Stiff neck.People with neck pain often describe feeling as though their neck is“stiff” or “stuck.”Neck pain can sometimes cause a decreased range of motion.\n\n* Sharp pain.Neck pain may feel like sharp or “stabbing” pain that is localized to one area.\n\n* Pain when moving.Neck pain is often exacerbated by moving, twisting, or extending your cervical spine, either from side to side or up and down.\n\n* Radiating pain or numbness.Your neck pain may radiate to your head, trunk, shoulder, and arms. If your neck pain involves thecompression of a nerve, you may feel numbness, tingling, or weakness in either of your arms or hands. Neck pain that is from a pinched nerve may feel like a burning or sharp pain that starts at the neck and travels down the arm. Talk with a doctor if you experience this symptom.\n\n* Headache.Pain that starts in your neck may also produce a headache called a cervicogenic headache. Neck pain with a headache may also be a symptom of amigraine headache.\n\n* Pain when palpated.Neck pain may increase if your cervical spine is palpated (physically examined).",
        "### Muscle tension and strain\n\nThis is usually from activities and behaviors such as:\n\n* poor posture\n\n* working at a desk for too long without changing position\n\n* sleeping with your neck in a bad position\n\n* jerking your neck during exercise",
        "### Injury\n\nThe neck is particularly vulnerable to injury, especially in falls, car accidents, and sports, where the muscles and ligaments of the neck are forced to move outside of their normal range.\n\nIf the neck bones (cervical vertebrae) are fractured, the spinal cord may also be damaged. Neck injury from sudden jerking of the head is commonly calledwhiplash.",
        "### Heart attack\n\nNeck pain can also be a symptom of aheart attack. It often presents with other symptoms of a heart attack, such as:\n\n* shortness of breath\n\n* sweating\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* armorjawpain\n\nIf your neck hurts and you have other symptoms of heart attack, call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately.",
        "### Meningitis\n\nMeningitisis an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. In people who have meningitis, they may experience:\n\n* stiff neck\n\n* headache\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* sensitivity to light\n\n* fever\n\nMeningitis can be fatal and is a medical emergency\n\nIf you have the symptoms of meningitis, seek medical help immediately.",
        "### Other causes\n\nOther causes of neck pain include the following:\n\n* Rheumatoid arthritiscauses pain, swelling of the joints, and bone spurs. When these occur in the neck area, neck pain can result.\n\n* Osteoporosisweakens bones and can lead to small fractures. This condition often happens in hands or knees, but it can also occur in the neck.\n\n* Fibromyalgiais a condition that causes muscle pain throughout the body, especially in the neck and shoulder region.\n\n* As you age, the cervical discs can degenerate. This is known asspondylosis, or osteoarthritis of the neck. This can narrow the space between the vertebrae. It also adds stress to your joints.\n\n* When a disc protrudes, as from a trauma or injury, it may add pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. This is called aherniated cervical disc, also known as a ruptured or slipped disc.\n\n* Spinal stenosisoccurs when the spinal column narrows and causes pressure on the spinal cord or the nerve roots as it exits the vertebrae. This can be from long-term inflammation caused by arthritis or other conditions.\n\nIn rare instances, neck stiffness or pain occurs due to:\n\n* congenital abnormalities\n\n* infections\n\n* abscesses\n\n* tumors\n\n* cancer of the spine",
        "## When to see your doctor\n\nIf symptoms persist for more than a week, consult a doctor. Also see a doctor if you have:\n\n* severe neck pain without apparent cause\n\n* a lump in your neck\n\n* fever\n\n* headache\n\n* swollen glands\n\n* nausea\n\n* vomiting\n\n* trouble swallowingor breathing\n\n* weakness\n\n* numbness\n\n* tingling\n\n* pain that radiates down your arms or legs\n\n* inability to move your arms or hands\n\n* inability to touch your chin to your chest\n\n* bladder or bowel dysfunction\n\nIf you’ve been in an accident or fall and your neck hurts, seek medical care immediately.",

In addition to a thorough history and physical exam by your doctor, you may also need one or more of the following imaging studies and tests to help your doctor determine the cause of your neck pain and make a diagnosis:\n\n* blood test\n\n* X-ray\n\n* CT scan\n\n* MRI scan\n\n* electromyography, which allows your doctor to check the health of your muscles and the nerves that control your muscles\n\n* lumbar puncture(spinal tap)\n\nDepending on the results, your doctor may refer you to a specialist. Treatment for neck pain may include:\n\n* ice and heat therapy\n\n* exercise, stretching, and physical therapy\n\n* pain medication\n\n* corticosteroid injections\n\n* muscle relaxants\n\n* neck collar\n\n* traction\n\n* antibiotics if you have an infection\n\n* hospital treatment, if a condition such as meningitis or heart attack is the cause\n\n* surgery, which is rarely necessary\n\nAlternative therapies include:\n\n* acupuncture\n\n* chiropractic treatment\n\n* massage\n\n* transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\n\nMake sure you’re seeing a licensed professional when using these methods.",

Slowly stretch your head in side-to-side and up-and-down motions.\n\n* Practice good posture.\n\n* Avoid cradling the phone between your neck and shoulder.\n\n* Change your position often. Don’t stand or sit in one position for too long.\n\n* Get a gentle neck massage.\n\n* Use a special neck pillow for sleeping.\n\n* Don’t use a neck brace or collar without your doctor’s approval. If you don’t use them properly, they can make your symptoms worse.",
        "## What’s the outlook for people with neck pain?\n\nMany people experience neck pain because of poor posture and muscle strain. In these cases, your neck pain should go away if you practice good posture and rest your neck muscles when they’re sore.\n\nMake an appointment with a doctor if your neck pain isn’t improving with home treatments.",

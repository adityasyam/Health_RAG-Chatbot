        "# Understanding Type 2 Diabetes\n\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the levels of sugar, or glucose, build up in your bloodstream. This happens because your body cannot react to insulin effectively or is unable to produce enough of it.\n\nTypically, the hormoneinsulinhelps move glucose from your blood to your cells, where it’s used for energy. But withtype 2 diabetes, your body’s cells aren’t able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the condition, your body may also not produce enough insulin.",
        "## Symptoms\n\nType 2 diabetes can develop slowly. The symptoms may be mild and easy to dismiss at first. Theearly symptomsmay include:\n\n* constant hunger\n\n* a lack of energy\n\n* fatigue\n\n* excessive thirst\n\n* frequent urination\n\n* blurry vision\n\n* pain, tingling, or numbness in your hands or feet\n\nAs the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe and can cause some potentially dangerous complications.",
        "## Causes\n\nInsulin is a naturally occurring hormone. Yourpancreasproduces it and releases it when you eat. Insulin helps transport glucose from your bloodstream to cells throughout your body, where it’s used for energy.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your body becomesresistant to insulin. Your body is no longer using the hormone efficiently. This forces your pancreas to work harder to make more insulin.\n\nOver time, this candamage cells in your pancreas. Eventually, your pancreas may not be able to produce any insulin.\n\nIf you don’t produce enough insulin or if your body doesn’t use it efficiently, glucose builds up in your bloodstream. This leaves your body’s cells starved for energy. Doctors don’t know exactly what triggers this series of events. It may have to do with cell dysfunction in the pancreas or with cell signaling and regulation.\n\nWhile the definitive trigger of type 2 diabetes is your body’s resistance to insulin, a combination of factors usually increases your risk of that resistance occurring.",
        "## Diagnosis\n\nEven if you do not have prediabetes, you should see your doctor right away if you think you may be experiencing symptoms of diabetes. Your doctor can get a lot of information from blood work.Diagnostic testingmay include the following:\n\n* Hemoglobin A1C test:This testmeasures your average blood glucose levels for the previous 2 or 3 months. You don’t need to fast for this test, and your doctor can diagnose diabetes based on the results. It’s also called a glycosylated hemoglobin test.\n\n* Fasting plasma glucose test:This test measures how much glucose is in your plasma. You may need tofast for 8 hoursbefore taking it.\n\n* Oral glucose tolerance test:Duringthis test, your blood is drawn three times: before drinking a dose of glucose, 1 hour after, and 2 hours after. The test results show how well your body deals with glucose before and after the drink.\n\nIf you have diabetes, your doctor will provide you with information about how to manage the disease, including:\n\n* how to monitor blood glucose levels on your own\n\n* dietary recommendations\n\n* physical activity recommendations\n\n* information about any medications that you need\n\nYou may need to see anendocrinologistwho specializes in the treatment of diabetes. You’ll probably need to visit your doctor more often at first to make sure your treatment plan is working.",
        "## Treatment\n\nType 2 diabetes can be managed and, in some cases, reversed. Most treatment plans will includechecking your blood glucose levels, and your doctor will let you know how often you should do it. The goal is to stay within a specific range.\n\nAdditional lifestyle changes your doctor will likely advise to help treat your type 2 diabetes include:\n\n* eating foods rich infiberandhealthy carbohydrates— eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can helpkeep your blood glucose levels steady\n\n* eating at regular intervals\n\n* learning to listen to your body and know when you’re full\n\n* managing your weight and keeping your heart healthy, which typically means keeping refined carbohydrates, sweets, and animal fats to a minimum\n\n* getting about half an hour ofphysical activitydaily to help keep your heart healthy —exercisecan help to regulate blood glucose, too\n\nNot everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to use insulin. If you do, it’s because your pancreas isn’t making enough insulin on its own, and it’s crucial that you take insulin as your doctor prescribes. There are other prescription medications that may help as well.",
        "## Medications\n\nIn some cases, lifestyle changes are enough to manage type 2 diabetes. If not, there are several medications that may help, including:\n\n* Metformin:Thiscan lower your blood glucose levels and improve how your body responds to insulin. It’sthe first-line treatmentfor most people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n* Sulfonylureas:These areoral medicationsthat help your bodymake more insulin.\n\n* Meglitinides:These are fast-acting, short-duration medications that stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin.\n\n* Thiazolidinediones:These make your body more sensitive to insulin.\n\n* Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors:These are milder medications that help reduce blood glucose levels.\n\n* Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists:These slow digestion and improve blood glucose levels.\n\n* Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors:These help yourkidneysremove sugar in your body through urine.\n\nEach type of medication listed above can cause side effects. It may take some time for you and your doctor to find thebest medicationor combination of medications to treat your diabetes.\n\nIf your body is unable to make enough insulin, you may needinsulin therapy. You may only need along-acting injectionyou can take at night, or you may need to take insulin several times per day.",
        "## Diet considerations\n\nDiet is an important tool to help maintain optimalheart healthandblood glucose levels that are within a safe range.\n\nThe diet recommended for people with type 2 diabetes isthe same diet that just about everyone should follow. It boils down to a few key actions:\n\n* Choose a variety of foods that are high innutrientsand low inempty calories.\n\n* Work on being mindful about portion sizes and stopping eating when you’re full.\n\n* Readfood labelsclosely to understand the amount of sugar or carbs you could be ingesting in a serving size.",
        "## The takeaway\n\nType 2 diabetes can be managed — and even reversed — with certain lifestyle changes. For more severe cases, medication is available.\n\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor about developing a treatment plan that works for your lifestyle.

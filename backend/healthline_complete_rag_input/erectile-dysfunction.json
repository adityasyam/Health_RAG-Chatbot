Exploring the prevalence of ED\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,around 30 million U.S. menhave ED.\n\nThe prevalence of ED increases with age. The University of Wisconsin estimates that mild or moderate ED affects10% more men for each decade of life. For example, 60% of men in their 60s might experience some form of ED.\n\nHowever, ED can also occur amongyounger people. One2013 studyfound that 1 in 4 men seeking their first treatment for ED was under 40 years old. Researchers observed a stronger correlation betweensmoking, drug use, and ED in these men when compared with older men. This suggests that lifestyle choices are an important factor for ED in younger men.\n\nAlthough the risk of ED increases with age, ED isn’t inevitable. In general, the healthier you are, the better your sexual function.Learn more about aging and ED.\n\nIf you have diabetes, work with your doctor tomanage your blood sugar levels.

        "### Psychosocial history\n\nYour doctor will ask you questions or request that you fill out a questionnaire about your symptoms, health history, and sexual history.

It can be administered in two ways: as a penile suppository, or as a self-injection at the base or side of the penis.\n\nIn most cases, however, alprostadil is not used alone as an injection, and the combination drug Trimix (alprostadil, phentolamine, papaverine) is used instead.\n\nYour doctor may recommendtestosterone replacement therapy (TRT)if you have low levels of testosterone.\n\nMedications used for other conditions may cause ED as well.

        "### Exercises for erectile dysfunction\n\nCertain exercises can also help with ED.\n\nKegel exercisesare simple movements you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Here’s how:\n\n* Identify your pelvic floor muscles. To do this, stop peeing midstream. The muscles you use to do this are your pelvic floor muscles.\n\n* Now that you know where these muscles are, contract them for 3 seconds. Then release them.\n\n* Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times in a row, three times per day.\n\nA small2005 studycompared two groups of men with ED. The first group of men performed regular pelvic floor muscle exercises with a physiotherapist. They also receivedbiofeedbackand advice on lifestyle changes. The second group only received advice on lifestyle changes.\n\nMen in the first group saw their penile function improve significantly after 3 months of regular pelvic floor muscle exercises. Men in the second group saw little improvement after 3 months.\n\nFor the next 3 months, all participants were given at-home exercises to perform. After 6 months in total, 40% of all participants, including some men who had belonged to the second group, had regained normal erectile function.\n\nA2019 literature reviewalso concluded that pelvic floor exercises were effective at treating both ED and premature ejaculation. However, the researchers didn’t identify an ideal exercise plan in terms of conditions such as frequency and intensity.\n\nYou may find that it’s easier initially to do Kegels while lying down. Eventually, you can start trying them when you’re sitting or standing.\n\nModerate to vigorous exercise is not only good for your overall health. It also can increase blood flow, possibly helping with ED. Examples include running andswimming.\n\nA2018 review of 10 studiesexamined the effect of aerobic exercise on ED. From their review, investigators concluded that 160 minutes of weekly exercise for 6 months could lead to a decrease in erectile problems.\n\nAnother2018 studyexamined physical fitness and testosterone levels in 87 men with ED. Researchers found that testosterone levels were negatively correlated with levels ofbody fatandabdominal fat. This suggests that exercise may increase testosterone in addition to reducing body fat.\n\nBefore you start a new exercise plan, always discuss it with your doctor. This is particularly important for people with heart disease or another underlying condition that could be aggravated by vigorous activity.Learn more about exercise and ED.\n\nYogacan help to relax your mind and body. Since stress or anxiety can cause or contribute to ED, practicing yoga may be an effective way to ease ED symptoms.\n\nIn fact, an older2010 studyof 65 men between 24 and 60 years old found that sexual function increased significantly after a 12-week program of yoga sessions.Discover five yoga poses that could help with ED.",
        "### Foods for erectile dysfunction\n\nED is often related to problems with blood flow. Maintaining your blood vessel health may be beneficial in both preventing and treating ED.

        "### Keep in mind\n\nDon’t buy herbs and supplements for ED treatment unless you speak with your doctor first. Many aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means they might contain additional ingredients not listed on their labels.\n\nAdditionally, some supplements, such as yohimbe, are associated with potentially dangerous side effects.\n\nYour doctor may be able to recommend reputable brands as well. Avoid purchasing products online, unless your doctor confirms that they’re safe.Get more expert advice on herbs for ED.\n\nAcupunctureis a type of traditional Chinese medicine in which needles are inserted into the skin at specific locations or acupoints. Acupuncture is believed to work through nerve stimulation, which then affects the release of neurotransmitters.\n\nIt’s unclear how acupuncture works to treat ED. Studies on its effectiveness are limited, and those that do exist are often inconclusive.\n\nFindings from a2019 research reviewsuggest that acupuncture may help treat psychological ED, but more studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness.\n\nWhen choosing an acupuncturist, look for a certified practitioner who uses disposable needles and follows FDA guidelines for needle disposal and sterilization.Learn more about the use of acupuncture in treating ED.",
        "## Erectile dysfunction surgery\n\nIn cases where medications aren’t effective, your doctor may recommend surgical treatment. Two types of procedures may be used: implants and vascular surgery.",
        "### Implants\n\nA surgeon can place apenile implant, also referred to as a prosthesis, in the penis.\n\nThere are two implant types:\n\n* An inflatable implant allows you to use a pump to make your penis larger.\n\n* A malleable implant allows you to adjust the position of your penis manually.\n\nPenile implants are typically reserved for severe ED that has been unresponsive to traditional ED treatments. Satisfaction and complication rates can vary among participants and could even lead to someone choosing to have the implant removed in some cases.\n\nIf you’re considering a penile implant, it’s worth talking with your doctor in detail about what you can expect from the surgery.",
        "### Vascular surgery\n\nVascular surgery repairs arteries that may be blocked. This type of surgery is rare, and usually only reserved for people with pelvic trauma that leads to vascular injury.\n\nThis type of surgery can help to restore adequate blood flow to the penis. Younger people are typically better candidates for this type of procedure.\n\nEvery surgery has its benefits and drawbacks. Be sure to discuss these with your doctor if you decide to undergo surgery for ED.\n\nCheck out this guide to penile implants, learn how they’re placed, and discover what recovery is like.",
        "### Erectile dysfunction and diabetes\n\nED and diabetes can occur together. In fact, according to a 2014 review, the risk of developing ED isapproximately 50%in men who have diabetes. But why is this?\n\nDiabetes affects how your body processesglucose. When your body doesn’t store glucose correctly, excess glucose can be found in your blood, leading tohigh blood sugar. There aretwo major types of diabetes:type 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes.\n\nHaving high amounts of sugar in your blood can lead to damage to the blood vessels and nerves. This damage can also affect the blood vessels and nerves located around the penis, leading to difficulties getting or maintaining an erection.",
        "## Ways to prevent erectile dysfunction\n\nYou can take several steps to help prevent ED. Many of these steps involve making healthy lifestyle changes. Therefore, they’re not only good for preventing ED, but also for improving your overall health.\n\nFollow the advice below to help prevent ED:\n\n* Manage medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\n* Make sure you getregular exercise.\n\n* Maintain amoderate weight.\n\n* Focus on eating ahealthy diet.\n\n* Find ways toreduce or manage stress.\n\n* Try to maintain aregular sleep schedule.\n\n* Get helpif you’re experiencing anxiety or depression.\n\n* Considermeeting with a psychotherapistto discuss your concerns.\n\n* Quit smokingif you smoke.\n\n* Only use alcoholin moderation.\n\n* Avoid using drugs that haven’t been recommended by your doctor.\n\nAlso, be sure to keep up with your regular checkups.

        "## When to talk with a doctor\n\nIf you are experiencing ED, it can be difficult to talk about it openly with your partner. However, ED is actually more common than you might think. Consider talking with your doctor so they can more accurately diagnose your symptoms.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to lose an erection from time to time, especially during periods of increased stress or sudden changes to your diet or lifestyle. But if you’re unable to have or keep an erection frequently over a few weeks, it’s worth contacting your doctor.\n\nIn some cases, your symptoms may not actually be stemming from ED but could be symptoms of another medical condition. Your doctor can run a series of tests and evaluations to screen for those medical conditions and ultimately rule them out as potential causes.\n\nThe symptoms of ED can be very frustrating and even embarrassing at times, but many resources are available that can help. If you are concerned that you may be experiencing ED, reach out to your doctor to frankly and honestly discuss your options.",
        "### What causes erectile dysfunction?\n\nThere are many common causes of erectile dysfunction. Some of them may include:\n\n* existing health conditions\n\n* diseases\n\n* stress\n\n* drug use\n\n* alcohol use\n\n* relationship issues\n\n* increased age",
        "### How young can you develop ED?\n\nWhile ED is more common in older people, it can occur inyounger peopletoo.\n\nA2013 studyfound that of the 439 participants ages 17 to 40 years old, 114 of them (26%) had experienced ED. This indicates that ED can start in someone’s late teens or early 20s, but it is still most common in people above 40.",
        "### How do I know whether my erectile dysfunction is physical or mental?\n\nIf your doctor diagnoses erectile dysfunction, they will also examine you to find out the root cause. Likely, they’ll give you a physical exam where they’ll check your vitals, as well as your genitals.\n\nThey may also give a psychological exam, where they’ll ask you questions about your health history, including your sexual and mental health.\n\nThe results of these exams will help determine whether your erectile dysfunction is physical or mental.",
        "### Can I combine erectile dysfunction treatments?\n\nYour specific treatment plan will depend on the causes of your ED, and treatment options will be decided by your doctor.\n\nTreatments may include a combination of medications, therapy, or devices, and you may need to try different treatment options before finding one that works.",
        "## Takeaway\n\nIn many cases, you can improve your ED symptoms. Many medications and treatments are available. Certain devices, such as vacuum pumps, can also help you temporarily manage your symptoms so that you can continue to engage in sexual intercourse.\n\nYour treatment plan will depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of your ED and whether it’s caused by a specific health condition. Your doctor will work closely with you to explain the benefits and risks associated with each type of treatment.\n\nIt’s important to remember that ED is a common condition.

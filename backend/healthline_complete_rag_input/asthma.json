        "# Everything You Need to Know About Asthma: Symptoms, Types, Causes, Prevention, and More\n\nAsthma occurs because of inflammation and mucus in the lining of your airways. During an attack, this inflammation causes a wheezing or whistling sound when you breathe, along with other symptoms.",
        "## What is asthma?\n\nAsthma is an inflammatory disease that can affect the airways to your lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),about 25 million peoplein the United States have asthma. It’s the most common chronic lung condition among children in the United States: In 2018, the CDC reported that about1 of every 12 childrenhad asthma.\n\nTo understand asthma, it’s necessary to know a little about what happens when you breathe. Usually, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth, down into your throat, and into your airways, eventually reaching your lungs.\n\nThere are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air to your bloodstream.\n\nAsthma symptoms happen when the lining of your airways swells and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills your airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.\n\nThese effects can bring on an asthma “attack,” which involves the coughing and chest tightness that are typical of asthma.",
        "## Symptoms\n\nThemost common symptom of asthmais wheezing — a squealing or whistling sound that happens when you breathe.\n\nOther possible asthma symptoms include:\n\n* coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise\n\n* tightness in your chest\n\n* shortness of breath\n\n* difficulty talking\n\n* anxiety or panic\n\n* fatigue\n\n* chest pain\n\n* rapid breathing\n\n* frequent infections\n\n* trouble sleeping\n\nThe type of asthma you have can determine which symptoms you experience.\n\nSome people experience symptoms consistently throughout the day. Others may find that certain activities make their symptoms worse.\n\nBut not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you’re experiencing could be related to a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see a healthcare professional.\n\nIf you have asthma, remember that even if your condition is well managed, you may occasionally have a flare-up of symptoms. Flare-ups often decrease with the use of quick-acting treatments, such as inhalers, but may require medical attention in severe cases.\n\nSymptoms of an asthma flare-up may include:\n\n* coughing\n\n* wheezing\n\n* throat clearing\n\n* difficulty sleeping\n\n* chest pain or tightness\n\n* fatigue\n\nIf your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with the use of an inhaler, you should seek immediate medical treatment.\n\nYou should also seek treatment if you have symptoms of an asthma emergency, such as:\n\n* severe trouble breathing\n\n* gasping for air\n\n* confusion\n\n* pale or blue lips or fingernails\n\n* dizziness\n\n* difficulty walking or talking",
        "### Call 911\n\nIf you or someone around you is experiencing symptoms of an asthma emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department.",
        "## Causes and triggers\n\nAlthough asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood.\n\nHealth experts havenot identifieda specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* Genetics:If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.\n\n* History of viral infections:People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma.\n\n* Hygiene hypothesis:When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.\n\nMany factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others.\n\nThe most common triggersinclude:\n\n* health conditions such as respiratory infections\n\n* exercise\n\n* environmental irritants\n\n* allergens\n\n* intense emotions\n\n* extreme weather conditions\n\n* pests\n\n* certain medications,includingaspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)",
        "## Types of asthma\n\nYour doctor will need to determine thetype of asthmayou have. The most common type isallergic asthma, which accounts for60%of all cases of asthma.\n\nSome types of asthma are related to your stage of life. While asthma can appear at any age, pediatric asthma specifically affects children, and adult-onset asthma doesn’tbeginuntil adulthood.\n\nThe sections below describe other specific types of asthma.",
        "### Allergic asthma\n\nThis common type of asthma is triggered by allergens, including:\n\n* pet dander from animals such as cats and dogs\n\n* food\n\n* mold\n\n* pollen\n\n* dust\n\nAllergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies.",
        "### Non-allergic asthma\n\nIrritants in the air that are not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include:\n\n* burning wood\n\n* cigarette smoke\n\n* cold air\n\n* air pollution\n\n* viral illnesses\n\n* air fresheners\n\n* household cleaning products\n\n* perfumes",
        "### Occupational asthma\n\nOccupational asthma is triggered by irritants in the workplace, such as:\n\n* dust\n\n* dyes\n\n* gases and fumes\n\n* industrial chemicals\n\n* animal proteins\n\n* rubber latex\n\nThese irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including:\n\n* farming\n\n* textiles\n\n* woodworking\n\n* manufacturing",
        "### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)\n\nEIB usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and can last until 10–15 minutes after physical activity.\n\nThis condition was previously called exercise-induced asthma.\n\nUp to 90%of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma.",
        "### Aspirin-induced asthma\n\nAspirin-induced asthma (AIA), or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, is usually severe.\n\nIt’s triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil).\n\nThe symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps.\n\nAbout 9% of peoplewith asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults ages 20–50 years.",
        "### Nocturnal asthma\n\nIn this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night.\n\nTriggers that might bring on symptoms at night include:\n\n* heartburn\n\n* pet dander\n\n* dust mites\n\nYour body’s natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma.",
        "### Cough-variant asthma (CVA)\n\nCVA doesn’t cause the classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. Instead, it involves a persistent dry cough.\n\nHowever, if it’s not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the more common symptoms.",
        "## Diagnosis\n\nNo single test or exam can determine whether you or your child has asthma. Instead, healthcare professionals will use a variety of criteria to find out whether your symptoms are the result of asthma.\n\nThe following steps can help healthcare professionalsdiagnoseasthma:\n\n* Health history:Tell your doctor if you have family members with asthma, since this can mean you have a greater chance of developing it.\n\n* Physical exam:Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. They may also perform a skin test to look for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or eczema. Allergies increase your risk for asthma.\n\n* Breathing tests:Pulmonary function tests measure the airflow into and out of your lungs. For the most common test, spirometry, you blow into a device that measures the speed of the air.",
        "### In children\n\nDoctors don’t typically perform breathing tests in children under 5 years of age because it’s difficult to get an accurate reading.\n\nInstead, they may prescribe asthma medications to your child and wait to see whether their symptoms improve. If your child’s symptoms improve with medication, your child likely has asthma.",
        "### In adults\n\nYour doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator or another asthma medication if your test results indicate asthma. If your symptoms improve with the use of this medication, your doctor will continue to treat your condition as asthma.",
        "## Treatment\n\nTo help treat asthma, theNational Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)classifies the condition based on its severity before treatment.\n\nAsthma classificationsinclude:\n\n* Intermittent:Most people have this type of asthma, which doesn’t interfere with daily activities. Symptoms are mild, occurring fewer than 2 days per week or 2 nights per month.\n\n* Mild persistent:The symptoms occur more than twice per week, but not daily, and up to 4 nights per month.\n\n* Moderate persistent:The symptoms occur daily and at least 1 night every week, but not nightly. They may limit some daily activities.\n\n* Severe persistent:The symptoms occur several times every day and most nights, and they greatly limit your daily activities.\n\nTreatments for asthma fall intofourprimary categories:\n\n* quick-relief medications\n\n* long-term control medications\n\n* a combination of quick-relief and long-term control medications, which is recommended by the most recentasthma clinical guidelines(released in 2020 by the NAEPP) butnot yet approvedby the Food and Drug Administration\n\n* biologics, which are given by injection or infusion and typically used for only severe forms of asthma\n\nYour doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on:\n\n* the type of asthma you have\n\n* your age\n\n* your triggers\n\nYour treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, carefully monitoring your symptoms, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups.",
        "### Quick-relief asthma treatments\n\nThese medications should be used only in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.\n\nBronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airways and quickly decrease your symptoms.\n\nAlthough they can come in the form of an oral medication or injection, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer.\n\nYour doctor may recommend that you use them to treat sudden asthma symptoms or take them before exercise to prevent a flare-up.\n\nIf you think someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and help them use their rescue inhaler or nebulizer.\n\nThe dosage will depend on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you knowhow many puffsof medications you need in the event of an attack.\n\nIf symptoms persist for more than20 minutesand a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek emergency medical attention.\n\nIf you need to use quick-relief medications frequently, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.",
        "### Long-term asthma control medications\n\nYou can take these medications daily to help reduce the number and severity of asthma symptoms. But they don’t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack.\n\nLong-term asthma control medicationsinclude:\n\n* Anti-inflammatories:Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways, making it easier to breathe.\n\n* Anticholinergics:These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airways. They’re usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories.\n\n* Long-acting bronchodilators:These should be used only in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications.",
        "### Biologics\n\nDoctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn’t respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger management.\n\nTheyworkby targeting specific antibodies in your body, disrupting the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation.\n\nThere are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others are in development. You can receive this type of medication either as an injection or as an infusion in your doctor’s office.",
        "### Bronchial thermoplasty\n\nThis treatment uses an electrode to heat the airways inside your lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening.\n\nA doctor will perform this minimally invasive procedure in a clinic or hospital. It usually takes about an hour.\n\nBronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to5 years.\n\nHowever, because it’s a relatively new procedure, it’s not yet widely available.",
        "## What is an asthma attack?\n\nWhen your asthma symptoms get progressively worse, it’s known as anexacerbation, or an asthma attack.\n\nBreathing becomes increasingly difficult because your airways are swollen and your bronchial tubes have narrowed.\n\nThe symptoms of an exacerbation mayinclude:\n\n* hyperventilation\n\n* cough\n\n* wheezing\n\n* shortness of breath\n\n* increased heart rate\n\n* agitation\n\n* confusion\n\n* blue lips\n\nAlthough an exacerbation can end quickly without medication, you should contact your doctor when you experience one, because it can be life threatening.\n\nThe longer an exacerbation lasts, the more it can affect your ability to breathe. That’s why exacerbations often require a trip to the emergency room.\n\nYou can help prevent exacerbations by taking medications that help manage your asthma symptoms.",
        "## Prevention and management\n\nBecause researchers have not yet found the exact cause, it’s challenging to know how to prevent asthma.\n\nBut some strategies can help prevent asthma attacks,including:\n\n* Avoiding triggers:Try to steer clear of chemicals, smells, or products that have caused breathing problems in the past.\n\n* Reducing exposure to allergens:If you’ve identified allergens, such as dust and mold, that trigger asthma attacks, avoid them whenever possible.\n\n* Getting allergy shots:Allergen immunotherapy is a type of treatment that may help change your immune system. With routine shots, your body may become less sensitive to triggers you encounter.\n\n* Taking preventive medication:Your doctor may prescribe medication for you to take every day (in addition to the one you use in case of an asthma attack).\n\nYour doctor can help you create an asthma action plan so you know which treatments to use and when.\n\nIn addition to using maintenance medications, you can take steps each day to improve your overall health and reduce your risk for asthma attacks. Theseinclude:\n\n* Eating a nutritious diet:A healthy, balanced diet can help improve your overall health.\n\n* Avoiding any foods you’re allergic to:Nutrient-rich foods are vital to helping reduce symptoms, but food allergies can trigger asthma symptoms.\n\n* Making efforts to maintain a moderate weight:Asthma tends to be worse in people with overweight or obesity. If your doctor recommends that you lose weight, doing so may be beneficial for your heart, joints, and lungs.\n\n* Quitting smoking, if you smoke:Cigarette smoke is an irritant that can trigger asthma and increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n* Exercising regularly:Physical activity can trigger asthma attacks, but regular exercise may actually help reduce your risk of breathing problems.\n\n* Finding healthy ways to manage stress:Stress can trigger asthma symptoms and make it more difficult to stop an asthma attack.",
        "## When to see a doctor\n\nAt the moment, there’s no cure for asthma. But there are many effective treatments that can decrease the symptoms. Lifestyle strategies and medications can also help improve your quality of life.\n\nIf you haven’t received an asthma diagnosis but you’re experiencing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a healthcare professional. You can find one in your area using theHealthline FindCare tool.\n\nIf you receive a diagnosis of asthma, you should see your doctor at least once per year. If you have persistent symptoms even after trying some treatments, you may need to see your doctor more often.\n\nCall your doctor immediately if you:\n\n* feel weak\n\n* can’t perform daily activities\n\n* have a wheeze or cough that won’t go away\n\nIt’s important to learn about your condition and its symptoms. The more you know, the more proactive you can be in improving your lung function and how you feel.\n\nTalk with your doctor about:\n\n* your type of asthma\n\n* what triggers your symptoms\n\n* what daily treatments are best for you\n\n* your treatment plan for an asthma attack",
        "### Can you use an expired inhaler?\n\nMost inhalers are safe to use for up to 1 year after their expiration date. However, the medication will gradually lose its potency over time, and the manufacturer can no longer guarantee its effectiveness.",
        "### Can you die from asthma?\n\nWhile asthma attacks can be mild and short, a severe asthma attack is a serious medical condition and has the potential to be fatal. Seek medical attention if you or someone else experiences the following symptoms:\n\n* breathlessness or wheezing that’s severe or quickly worsens\n\n* shortness of breath that’s so bad you can speak in only short phrases\n\n* the need to strain hard in order to breathe\n\n* lips or fingernails that have turned gray or blue\n\n* no symptom relief after using your rescue inhaler",
        "### Am I having an asthma attack or an anxiety attack?\n\nAn anxiety attack and an asthma attack can sometimes feel very similar, as both can involve shortness of breath, insomnia, and fatigue.\n\nWatch for wheezing and coughing, which are clear symptoms of asthma. Choking sensations and muscle tension are more common in an anxiety attack.",
        "## Takeaway\n\nAsthma is a condition that inflames your lungs and makes breathing difficult. It can affect both adults and children and has multiple forms and varying levels of severity.\n\nThere are some medications available to treat asthma. The most common treatments are bronchodilators, which can be used in the short term to treat an asthma attack or in the long term to manage symptoms over time.\n\nLifestyle strategies such as dietary changes, exercise, and stress management may also help reduce asthma flare-ups. A doctor can identify the type of asthma you have and help you find the best treatment and management options.\n\nRead this article in Spanish.",

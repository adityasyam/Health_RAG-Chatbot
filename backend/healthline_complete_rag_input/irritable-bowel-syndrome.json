The cause of IBS is not clear but may be related to an overly sensitive colon or immune system.\n\nAccording to research from 2021,7–16 %of Americans experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.\n\nThe condition affects more women and young people. Some people with IBS have minor symptoms. However, for others, the symptoms are significant and disrupt daily life.\n\nLearn about IBS, its symptoms, causes, triggers, and treatment.",
        "## What is IBS?\n\nIBS is also known as spastic colon, irritable colon, mucous colitis, and spastic colitis. It is a separate condition frominflammatory bowel diseaseand isn’t related to other bowel conditions.\n\n\n\nIBS is a group of intestinal symptoms that typically occur together. The symptoms vary in severity and duration from person to person. Types of IBS are classified based on certain specific symptoms that occur, such as constipation and weight loss.\n\nOneoverview from 2018indicates that to diagnose IBS, healthcare professionals look for symptoms that have occurred at least 3 days per month for the last 3 months.\n\nIBS can cause intestinal damage in some cases.

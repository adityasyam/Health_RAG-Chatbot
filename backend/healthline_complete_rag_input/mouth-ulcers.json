        "### Herpetiform canker sore\n\nHerpetiform canker sores are pinpoint-sized, occur in clusters, and often appear on the tongue. Sometimes the clusters can merge to form one large sore.\n\nHerpetiform canker sores have irregular edges and often heal, without scarring,within 1 month.\n\nThey’re called “herpetiform” because they may resemble the sores caused byherpes. Herpetiform canker sores are not otherwise associated with herpes infection.",

Although mouth ulcers and cold sores share some causes and symptoms, it’s usually easy to tell the two apart.\n\nMouth ulcers only appear inside the mouth.\n\nAlthough cold sores can appear inside the mouth, they mainly appear right above, below, or on your lips. They may also spread to the nose orchin. Cold sores are also fluid-filled, making them a type ofblister.\n\nMost mouth ulcers are not contagious. Cold sores are typically caused by the herpes virus and are always contagious.\n\nCold sores are also more likely to cause additional symptoms beyond the lesions, including:\n\n* fever\n\n* fatigue\n\n* malaise\n\n* swollen lymph nodesin the neck\n\nBoth types of lesions can cause a burning or tingling sensation on the skin that may start a few days before the lesions appear.

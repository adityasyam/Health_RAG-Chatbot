It covers types, causes, symptoms, and treatments, noting that most cysts are benign and disappear on their own but may require surgery if complications occur. Hormonal treatments can help prevent cysts, and regular check-ups aid early detection.",

        "# Ovarian Cysts\n\nOvarian cysts are very common. Often painless and symptomless, they are usually just a sign of ovulation. In some cases, they can point to an underlying condition and may need to be removed.\n\nTheovariesare part of the female reproductive system. There are two ovaries, and they’re located in the lower abdomen on both sides of theuterus. The ovaries produce egg, as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\n\nRead on to learn more about the types of ovarian cysts, what causes them, when they may need treatment, how they can be prevented, and more.",
        "### The terms “male” and “female”\n\nIn this article, we use “male and female” to refer to someone’s sex as determined by their chromosomes and “men and women” when referring to their gender (unless quoting from sources using nonspecific language).\n\nChromosomes determine sex, and gender is a social construct that can vary between periods and cultures. Both of these aspects are acknowledged to exist on a spectrum both historically and by modern scientific consensus.",
        "## What are the types of ovarian cysts?\n\nThere are various ovarian cysts, such as dermoid cysts and endometriomas (also called chocolate cysts).\n\nHowever, the most common type is cysts filled with fluid formed during themenstrual cycle.\n\nThese are follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts.",
        "### Follicular cysts\n\nDuring themenstrual cycle, an egg grows in a follicle sac. This sac is located inside the ovaries.\n\nIn most cases, the follicle breaks open and releases an egg. If the follicle doesn’t break open, the fluid inside the follicle can form a cyst on the ovary.\n\nLearn more about follicular cysts.",
        "### Corpus luteum cysts\n\nThecorpus luteumis a benign structure that appears in an ovary after an egg is released. It’s job is to release hormones needed for pregnancy. However, it will break down after a few days unless a pregnancy starts.\n\nIn some cases, it may not dissolve. Instead, additional fluiddevelopsinside it, resulting in a cyst.",
        "### Other types\n\nOvarian cysts that aren’t formed as part of a typical menstrual cycle include:\n\n* Dermoid cysts: Thesesac-like growthson the ovaries can contain hair, fat, and other tissue.\n\n* Endometriomas: Tissues that normally grow inside the uterus can develop outside the uterus and attach to the ovaries. These are also colloquially called chocolate cysts, and may affect people with severeendometriosis.\n\n* Cystadenomas: These growths can develop on the outer surface of the ovaries.\n\nSome people develop a condition calledpolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which the ovaries form many small cysts. PCOS can cause the ovaries toenlarge. If left untreated, polycystic ovaries can result ininfertility.",
        "## What does it feel like to have an ovarian cyst?\n\nOften times, ovarian cysts don’t cause any symptoms. However, symptoms can appear ifthe cyst grows. Symptoms may include:\n\n* abdominalbloatingorswelling\n\n* painful bowel movements\n\n* pelvic pain before orduringthe menstrual cycle\n\n* painful intercourse\n\n* pain in thelower backor thighs\n\n* breast tenderness\n\n* nausea and vomiting",
        "### How do you know if an ovarian cyst has burst?\n\nSevere symptoms can indicate anovarian torsionor aruptured cyst. These include:\n\n* severe or sharp pelvic pain\n\n* fever\n\n* faintness ordizziness\n\n* rapid breathing\n\nBoth complications are rare, but can have serious consequences if not treated early.",
        "## Diagnosing an ovarian cyst\n\nAdoctormay detect an ovarian cyst during a routinepelvic exam. They may notice swelling on one of your ovaries and order anultrasoundto confirm the presence of a cyst.\n\nAnultrasoundis an imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your internal organs. Ultrasound tests help determine the size, location, shape, and composition (solid or fluid-filled) of a cyst.\n\nOther imaging tools that may be used to diagnose ovarian cysts include:\n\n* CT scan: ACT scanuses a body imaging device to create cross-sectional images of internal organs.\n\n* MRI:AnMRIuses magnetic fields to produce in-depth images of internal organs.\n\nBecause most cysts disappear after a few weeks or months, the doctor may not immediately recommend a treatment plan.\n\nInstead, they may repeat the ultrasound test in a few weeks or months to check your condition. In certain cases, no further monitoring will be needed, especially if you previously had a follicular cyst or corpus luteum cyst.\n\nIf there aren’t any improvements to your condition or the cyst increases in size, the doctor may request additional tests to determine other causes of your symptoms.\n\nThese may include apregnancy testor hormone level tests. The hormone level test helps check for hormone-related issues, such as having too muchestrogenorprogesterone.\n\nIf you don’t already have a obgyn, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool.",
        "## Treatments for an ovarian cyst\n\nMost ovarian cysts are benign and naturally go away on their own without treatment. These cysts cause little, if any, symptoms.Home remedieslikeheat therapycan help ease any symptoms you do have.\n\nThat said, if treatment is necessary, the kind of treatment will depend on the type of the cyst. Some larger cysts, endometromas, or cancerous cysts usuallyneed to be removedsurgically.\n\nOptions for surgery include:\n\n* Laparoscopy: A doctor performs alaparoscopyby making several tiny incisions near your navel and inserting a small instrument into your abdomen to remove the cyst.\n\n* Laparotomy: In this procedure, a doctor can surgically remove the cyst through a large incision in your abdomen. This is known as laparotomy. They can then do abiopsyif they are concerned about cancer.",
        "## Complications of ovarian cysts\n\nIn a rare case, a doctor may detect acancerous cystic ovarian massduring a routine examination.\n\nOvarian torsion is another rare complication of ovarian cysts. It occurs when a large cyst causes an ovary to twist or move from its original position. Blood supply to the ovary is cut off. If not treated, ovarian torsion can cause damage or death to the ovarian tissue.\n\nRuptured cysts rarely cause intense pain andinternal bleeding. This complication increases your risk of an infection and can be life threatening if left untreated.",
        "## Prevention of ovarian cysts\n\nIf you have recurring ovarian cysts, a doctor can prescribeoral contraceptivesto stop ovulation and prevent the development of new cysts.\n\nOral contraceptives can also help reduce your risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer is higher in postmenopausal females.\n\nIn addition, in a study on rats,researchersfound that combiningsupplements of the antioxidant resveratroland the diabetes medicationmetforminmay help support healthy weight and hormone levels, as well as an optimized follicular cell structure within the ovaries. This may help prevent cyst formation.\n\nRoutine gynecologic examinations can also help a doctor detect ovarian cysts early.\n\nAlert a doctor to symptoms that may indicate a problem, such as:\n\n* changes to your menstrual cycle\n\n* ongoing pelvic pain\n\n* loss of appetite\n\n* unexplained weight loss\n\n* abdominal fullness\n\nBenign ovarian cystsrarely becomecancerous. However, symptoms ofovarian cancercan mimic symptoms of an ovarian cyst. Thus, it’s important to visit a doctor and receive a correct diagnosis.",
        "## Long-term outlook\n\nThe outlook for premenopausal people with ovarian cysts is good. Most cysts disappear within a few months. However, premenopausal people and people with hormone imbalances such as PCOS can also experience recurring ovarian cysts.\n\nIf left untreated, some cysts can decrease fertility. This really depends on the type of cyst. Ovulatory cysts indicate regular menstrual cycles, but endometriomas suggest endometriosis, which can harm fertility. Dermoid cysts can cause pain and make sexual intercourse more painful, affecting conception.\n\nTo improve fertility, a doctor can remove or shrink the cyst. However, laproscipic removal of some types of cystscould also negatively impactyour fertility.\n\nDepending on cyst size and type, a “wait and see” approach may be appropriate with ovarian cysts.\n\nA doctor may recommend surgery to remove and examine any cyst or growth that develops on the ovariesafter menopause. This is because the chance of developing a cancerous cyst or ovarian cancer increases after menopause. However, ovarian cysts don’t increase the chance of getting ovarian cancer.\n\nRead the article in Spanish.",

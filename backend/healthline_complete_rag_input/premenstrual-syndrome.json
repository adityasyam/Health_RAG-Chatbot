        "# PMS: Premenstrual Syndrome Symptoms, Treatments, and More\n\nPMS is the changes in mood, emotions, physical health, and behavior that can occur between ovulation and the start of your period. It typically lasts until a few days after your period begins and can have a negative impact on your life.\n\nPre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) is a very common concern. Nearly48 percentof women who are of reproductive age experience PMS, and for about 20 percent of them, symptoms are severe enough to affect their regular routine.\n\nContrary to what some people may suggest, PMS is a real condition, one that can disrupt daily life and cause significant physical discomfort and emotional distress.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover the symptoms of PMS in detail, plus offer some tips on getting support and relief from your symptoms.",
        "## Symptoms of PMS\n\nWhile PMS often involves mild or moderate symptoms that don’t majorly affect daily life, symptomscanbe severe enough to impact your everyday activities and overall well-being.\n\nIf you have PMS, you’ll experience symptoms consistently before each menstrual period. You might experience only some of the symptoms below, or several, but PMS typically involves at least a few different symptoms.",
        "### Emotional and behavioral symptoms\n\nPMS-related changes in your mood, emotions, and behavior might include:\n\n* anxiety, restlessness, or feeling on edge\n\n* unusual anger andirritability\n\n* changes in appetite, includingincreased food cravings, especially for sweets\n\n* changes in sleep patterns, including fatigue and trouble sleeping\n\n* a sad or low mood, which might involve tearfulness or sudden, uncontrollable crying\n\n* rapid shifts in moodand emotional outbursts\n\n* decreasedsex drive\n\n* difficulty concentratingor remembering information",
        "### Physical symptoms\n\nWith PMS, you’ll likely also notice some physical symptoms, such as:\n\n* abdominal bloating\n\n* cramping\n\n* sore and swollen breasts\n\n* acne\n\n* constipation\n\n* diarrhea\n\n* headaches\n\n* back and muscle pain\n\n* unusual sensitivity to light or sound\n\n* unusual clumsiness",
        "### When do PMS symptoms begin?\n\nOn average, the menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days. If you have an average-length cycle:\n\n* Ovulation, or the egg’s release from the ovaries, will occur around day 14, or the midpoint of the cycle.\n\n* PMS symptoms can begin any time after ovulation (though they typically begin in the week before your period) and last until 5 or so days after menstruation begins.\n\n* Menstruation, or bleeding, will begin on day 28 of the cycle.\n\nLearn more about the stages of the menstrual cycle.",
        "## What causes PMS?\n\nScientific research hasn’t led to a conclusive cause of PMS, or an explanation for why some people experience it more severely than others. That said, researchers have suggested a few different theories.",
        "### Cyclical changes in hormones\n\nMany experts believe PMS happens in response to changing levels of thehormonesestrogen and progesterone.\n\nThese hormones naturally fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase, which follows ovulation, hormones reach a peak and then decline rapidly, which may lead to anxiety, irritability, and other changes in mood.",
        "### Chemical changes in the brain\n\nThe neurotransmittersserotoninandnorepinephrinehave several important functions in the body, including helping regulate mood, emotions, and behavior.\n\nThese chemical messengers may also factor into symptoms of PMS.\n\nFor example, a drop in estrogen may prompt the release of norepinephrine, which leads to declining production ofdopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. These changes can trigger sleep problems and lead to a low or depressed mood.",
        "### Existing mental health conditions\n\nLiving with a mental health condition, such asdepressionoranxiety, could raise your chances of experiencing PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a more severe form of PMS.\n\nA family history of PMS,bipolar disorder, or depression, includingpostpartum depression, can also increase this risk.\n\nYou might also noticepremenstrual exacerbation. This means symptoms of underlying mental health conditions, like bipolar disorder or depression, intensify shortly before your period begins.\n\nExperts have yet to arrive at a conclusive explanation for the link between mental health symptoms and menstruation-related mood changes. But many believe it relates to the chemical changes in the brain discussed above.",
        "### Lifestyle factors\n\nCertain habits might affect the severity of your PMS symptoms. Potential lifestyle factors that could worsen PMS symptoms include:\n\n* smoking\n\n* eating a lot of foodshigh in fat, sugar, and salt\n\n* a lack of regular physical activity\n\n* a lack of quality sleep\n\nResearch from 2018also links alcohol use to increased risk of PMS. If youbinge drink or drink heavilyon a regular basis, you’re even more likely to experience PMS symptoms.",
        "## Could it be PMDD?\n\nPMDD, which tends to involves more drastic and overwhelming changes in mood, can have a major impact on day-to-day life. The most recent edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)” recognizes PMDD as a mental health condition.\n\nAn estimated3 to 8 percentof menstruating women experience PMDD. That said, the actual number of people living with PMDD could be higher.\n\nMany people never seek help for symptoms, and those who do often experience dismissal and lack of support from healthcare professionals.\n\nAs with PMS, PMDD symptoms may occur due to fluctuations in levels of estrogen, progesterone, andserotonin.\n\nSymptoms of PMDD might include:\n\n* depression, intense sadness, andcrying spells\n\n* thoughts of suicide\n\n* panic attacks\n\n* anxiety, anger, or irritability\n\n* sudden shifts in mood\n\n* a lack of interest in daily activities\n\n* insomnia\n\n* trouble thinking or focusing\n\n* binge eating\n\n* painful cramping\n\n* bloating",
        "### Having thoughts of suicide?\n\nIt can be tough to talk about intense emotions or persistent thoughts of death, dying, or suicide.

        "## When to reach out to a doctor\n\nMost people who menstruate report at least a few symptoms of PMS, but these symptoms won’t necessarily show up every month or affect your everyday life.\n\nIf PMS symptoms become severe enough to disrupt your regular routine on a monthly basis, a good next step involves reaching out to a doctor or clinician.\n\nHealthcare professionals can diagnose PMS or PMDD and help you explore potential options for treatment, such as:\n\n* hormonal birth control\n\n* supplements, including calcium, magnesium, or vitamin B6\n\n* mefenamic acid\n\nTo make an accurate diagnosis, they may:\n\n* ask about your personal and family history of PMS, PMDD, and other mood and mental health conditions\n\n* ask about your family history of other health conditions, includinghypothyroidismorendometriosis\n\n* recommend apelvic examto rule out gynecological conditions, depending on your symptoms\n\n* suggest keeping a diary and calendar to track menstruation and any related symptoms you experience for 2 to 3 months\n\nIf your symptoms show up consistently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and disappear shortly after your period begins, a healthcare professional may diagnose PMS.\n\nOn the other hand, if they linger throughout the entire month or come and go without any regularity, they may link them to premenstrual exacerbation or another health condition.\n\nOther conditions that may involve similar symptoms include:\n\n* anemia\n\n* endometriosis\n\n* thyroid disorder\n\n* irritable bowel syndrome(IBS)\n\n* chronic fatigue syndrome",
        "## Easing the symptoms of PMS\n\nWhile there’s no cure for PMS, youcantake steps to ease your symptoms.\n\nTo get relief from mild or moderate symptoms, it may help to give the following strategies a try:\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids to ease abdominal bloating. This includesherbal teas, like red raspberry leaf orchamomile, which may ease cramping.\n\n* Eat abalanced dietthat includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n* Consider cutting back onsugar, salt, caffeine, and alcohol, especially if you’re particularly sensitive to their effects.\n\n* Ask a healthcare professional about trying supplements likefolic acid,vitamin B-6,calcium, andmagnesiumto help reduce cramps and mood symptoms.\n\n* Try getting morevitamin Dvianatural light,food, orsupplements.\n\n* Aim to get7 to 9 hours of sleepeach night to help relieve fatigue and improve overall well-being.\n\n* Try to getat least half an hourof physical activity each day, if you’re able. Exercise can not only help relieve bloating and cramping, but it can also help ease anxiety and depression symptoms.\n\n* Set aside time each day forself-care, which might include exercise,relaxation, time to yourself for hobbies, or time for social interaction.\n\nOver-the-counter medications and treatments can also help reduce physical PMS symptoms. Options include:\n\n* pain relievers, like ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen, for head and muscle aches or stomach cramping\n\n* diureticsto help relieve bloating and sore or tender breasts\n\n* heat wraps or heating pads on your abdomen to relieve cramps\n\nIf you have severe mood symptoms that create complications in your daily life,cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)orother therapy approachescan help you learn new ways to reframe and cope with distressing thoughts and emotions.",
        "## The bottom line\n\nIf PMS symptoms affect your routine and quality of life month after month, and home remedies and over-the-counter medications make little difference, it’s always best to connect with a healthcare professional.\n\nSevere PMS symptoms may require a more in-depth treatment approach, but they do often improve with treatment. A doctor or clinician can offer more guidance on developing a personalized treatment plan that makes a difference for you.",

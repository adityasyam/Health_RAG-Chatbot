        "## Osteoarthritis symptoms\n\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis may vary depending on the severity of your condition and which part of your body is affected.\n\nThe most common symptoms of osteoarthritis mayinclude:\n\n* joint pain\n\n* stiffness in the joint\n\n* loss of flexibility\n\n* reduced range of motion\n\n* tenderness or discomfort when pressing on the affected areas with your fingers\n\n* joint inflammation\n\n* crepitus, or grating, crackling, clicking, or popping sounds when moving your joints\n\n* bone spurs, or extra lumps of bone, which are typically painless\n\nAs osteoarthritis becomes more advanced, the pain associated with it may become more intense. Over time,swelling in the jointand surrounding area may also occur.\n\nLearn more about thesymptoms of osteoarthritis.",
        "## Osteoarthritis causes\n\nOsteoarthritis is caused by gradualjoint and cartilage damage.\n\nCartilageis a tough, rubbery substance that protects the ends of bones within a joint, allowing them to move easily against each other. With osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other. This may cause intense pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms.\n\nResearchers don’t yet know the underlying cause of this gradual joint degeneration, according to theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.\n\nHowever,several osteoarthritis risk factorshave been identified, which may contribute to the development and progression of the condition. These mayinclude:\n\n* genetics, such as having a family member with the condition\n\n* past injuries, such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries\n\n* being age 50 years and older\n\n* being assigned female at birth\n\n* having overweight orobesity\n\n* having gone throughmenopause\n\n* having anoccupationthat involves kneeling, climbing, heavy lifting, or similar actions\n\n* having another medical condition that affects your joint health, such as adifferent type of arthritis\n\nLearn more about thepossible causes of osteoarthritis.",
        "## Types of osteoarthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis may affect different parts of your body.\n\nIt most commonly affects thekneesandhips, but it may occur in any joint. Other types of osteoarthritisinclude:\n\n* hands osteoarthritis\n\n* fingers osteoarthritis\n\n* shoulder osteoarthritis\n\n* spinal osteoarthritis\n\n* cervical osteoarthritis (spondylosis)\n\nOsteoarthritis is a progressive condition, which means symptoms may spread to other parts of your body. Having osteoarthritis in one part of your body may also increase your risk of developing the condition in other body parts, according to theArthritis Foundation.",
        "## Stages of osteoarthritis\n\nOsteoarithis is a progressive condition that may be classified intofour stages. This may depend on the severity of your symptoms and the degree of joint and cartilage damage.\n\nThefour stagesof osteoarthritis are:\n\n* Stage 1 (Mild): You may experienceearly symptoms of osteoarthritis, but your cartilage is still in good shape.\n\n* Stage 2 (Moderate): You may experience sharp, acute symptoms. Your cartilage is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\n* Stage 3 (Advanced): You may experience constant osteoarthritis symptoms, especially when you apply weight to the affected joint. The joint cartilage is also almost completely gone.\n\n* Stage 4 (Severe): This is themost severe formof osteoarthritis. You may experience:severe pain, stiffness, and inflammationdecreased range of motionjoint instability, such as suddenlockingorbucklingother symptoms, such asmuscle weakness, bone spurs, and joint deformity\n\n* severe pain, stiffness, and inflammation\n\n* decreased range of motion\n\n* joint instability, such as suddenlockingorbuckling\n\n* other symptoms, such asmuscle weakness, bone spurs, and joint deformity\n\nDuring stage 4 osteoarthritis, you’ll likely need surgery to reduce your symptoms and increase mobility, function, and quality of life.\n\nLearn more about thefour stages of osteoarthritis.",
        "## Osteoarthritis diagnosis\n\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that usually develops gradually. It may be hard to provide an accurate diagnosis in the early stages.\n\nA healthcare professionalwill startwith a physical examination and ask about your symptoms and medical history.\n\nThey may then order imaging tests to get a better look at your joints, such asX-rayorMRI.\n\nIn some cases, a doctormay orderanESR blood testor asynovial (joint) fluid analysisto see if other conditions may be causing inflammation or joint pain. Some conditions they may rule outinclude:\n\n* rheumatoid arthritis\n\n* psoriatic arthritis\n\n* gout\n\n* pseudogout\n\n* hemochromatosis\n\n* bursitis\n\nIf you need help finding a primary care doctor, check out ourHealthline FindCare tool.",

        "## Complications of osteoarthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis may lead to a variety of physical, mental, and emotional complications if left untreated.\n\nA common complication of osteoarthritis is increased stiffness in your joints, which could lead to impaired balance and mobility. According to theArthritis Foundation, this may significantly increase your risk of falling, which could lead to minor or severe injuries.\n\nOther possible complications of osteoarthritis may include:\n\n* poor sleep\n\n* weight gain as a result of pain or limited mobility\n\n* anxiety\n\n* depression\n\n* osteonecrosis, or bone death\n\n* erosion of theligaments and tendons\n\n* hairline (stress) fractures\n\n* hemarthrosis, or bleeding near the joints\n\nLearn more about thecomplications of osteoarthritis.",
        "## Osteoarthritis prevention\n\nYou may have risk factors for osteoarthritis that you can’t change, such as heredity and age.\n\nHowever, there are several modifiable risk factors that could be prevented with the following tips:\n\n* maintain ahealthy-for-you weight\n\n* get at least150 minutesof low impact exercise each week\n\n* manage your blood sugar levels, especially if you havediabetes\n\n* manage your blood pressure, especially if you havehypertension\n\n* eat awell-balanced, anti-inflammatory diet\n\n* use proper techniques when lifting objects, such as lifting with your hips and legs instead of your back\n\n* use assistive devices, such ascanes\n\n* wearproper footwear\n\nLearn more abouthow to prevent osteoarthritis.",
        "## Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) share similar symptoms, but they’re two different conditions.\n\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative condition, which means it increases in severity over time.\n\nRA mayalso causeprogressive joint damage over time if left untreated.\n\nHowever, RA is anautoimmune disorder. This means the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy, soft lining (synovium) around your joints. As the immune system launches its assault, fluid buildup occurs within the joint. This causes stiffness, pain, swelling, and inflammation.\n\nIf you’re unsure which form of arthritis you may have, speak with a doctor. They can provide a proper diagnosis and develop a treatment plan for your condition.\n\nLearn more about thedifferences between osteoarthritis and RA.",
